**Washington** – As part of the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan, the General Services Administration (GSA) was tasked with developing a Curated Data Skills Catalog (Action 13) and a Data Ethics Framework (Action 14).

* [The Curated Data Skills Catalog (Catalog)](https://strategy.data.gov/feedback/action-13/) can be used to help agencies develop competencies for managing data as a strategic asset and making data-driven decisions. A focus group of data experts from across nine federal agencies was convened to determine the significant roles in the data ecosystem within the Federal government, list skills affiliated with these key functions, and create the draft Catalog.
* [The Data Ethics Framework (Framework)](https://strategy.data.gov/feedback/action-14/) can be used by agency staff, managers, and leaders to help guide the ethical management and use of data throughout the data lifecycle. To develop the draft Framework, GSA collaborated with an inter-agency team comprised of 14 government leaders who are experts in their respective data-focused domains.

**Your Opportunity to Comment:** GSA requests feedback from subject matter experts, data ethics leaders, federal councils, and the public to further build and refine the Catalog and the Framework. Both the draft Catalog and the draft Framework will be available for Open Comment from **Wednesday, September 2nd to Wednesday, September 16th, 2020**.

Your feedback is important to making these resources meaningful and actionable. The final Catalog will be posted to Resources.data.gov by November 30, 2020 while the final Framework will be posted to Resources.data.gov by December 31, 2020 for use across the Federal Government.
