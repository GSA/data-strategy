**Washington** – Today, the Federal Data Strategy working group published a new playbook to help federal agencies plan and hold data innovation events.

The new playbook includes examples and templates to help generate ideas for events customized to meet each agency’s needs in promoting and strengthening their data-related efforts.

Data innovation events are prime examples of investing in learning and developing data leaders, two of the foundational principles upon which the Federal Data Strategy is based. These types of events also exemplify a number of the Strategy’s practices including championing data use, connecting data functions across agencies, and supporting federal stakeholders.
