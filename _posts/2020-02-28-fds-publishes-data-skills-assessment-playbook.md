**Washington** – Today, the Federal Data Strategy working group published a new playbook to help federal agencies assess their staff data skills.

Identifying gaps, developing a strategy to fill them, and building a culture within the agency that values data use in everyday work will allow agencies to better harness the power of data.

The new playbook expands upon the four major components of a data skills capacity assessment:
1. Identify critical data skills needed for the agency.
2. Assess the current staff capacity for those data skills.
3. Perform a data skills gap analysis to prioritize the agency’s needs.
4. Identify and execute approaches to meet those needs.
