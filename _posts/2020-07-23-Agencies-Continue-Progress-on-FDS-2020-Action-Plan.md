**Washington** â€“ As of June 30, federal agencies have completed 12 of the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan milestones.

Recent highlights include:

* The Federal Statistical Research Data Center program, under the direction of the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy, piloted the [One-stop Standard Research Application portal](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/appfed/index.html). 
* GSA hosted five stakeholder engagement activities to collect input on a curated data skills catalog and made more than two dozen revisions based on feedback. 
* GSA, along with the Chief Data Officer Council and the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy, completed an initial examination of ethical issues encountered across the data lifecycle in the process of drafting a data ethics framework. 
* GSA ensured that all necessary interoperability has been completed for its enhanced data management tool, and that it is consistent with the current Federal Open Data schema. In addition, GSA developed a business plan and cost model, and uploaded them to [resources.data.gov](https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/datagov-ckan-product-plan.pdf).

Achieving milestones builds a solid foundation that will support agencies as they implement the strategy over the next decade. Together, agencies will leverage the full value of federal data for mission, service, and the public good through ethical governance and conscious design.
