The Administration has released the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan.

The action plan is a flagship product of the *President’s Management Agenda*, and a direct result of *Cross-Agency Priority Goal 2 “Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset”* led by the Executive Office of the President’s Office of Management and Budget and Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department of Commerce, and the Small Business Administration.

Designed to be cross-cutting and to support agencies in fulfilling a wide array of legislative and administrative requirements, the action plan prioritizes foundational activities for agencies in developing a mature data asset management environment.

The plan's 20 actions are aligned into three distinct categories:

1. Agency Actions
2. Community of Practice Actions
3. Shared Solution Actions

Federal agencies are reviewing the plan as they prepare to implement it in Calendar Year 2020. Additional resources and events will be rolled out throughout the year.
