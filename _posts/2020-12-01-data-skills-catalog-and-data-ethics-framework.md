**Washington** – The mission of the Federal Data Strategy (FDS) is to fully leverage the value of federal data for mission, service, and the public good.

As part of the FDS 2020 Action Plan, the General Services Administration (GSA) committed to complete **Action 13: Develop a Curated Data Skills Catalog (Catalog) and Action 14: Develop a Data Ethics Framework (Framework)**.

* The **[Catalog](https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/fds-data-skills-catalog.pdf)** can be used to help agencies develop competencies for managing data as a strategic asset and making data-driven decisions. 
* The **[Framework](https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf)** can be used by federal leaders and data users as they make ethical decisions when acquiring, managing, and using data to support their agency’s mission.

The release of these products marks the culmination of months of work by data experts across the Federal Government. We are grateful to the teams who made this possible. The Catalog and Framework are [now available](https://resources.data.gov/categories/data-management-governance/) on resources.data.gov. Read and use today!

**What’s Next?** 

The Catalog will be maintained by the Chief Data Officers (CDO) Council, while the Framework will be reviewed and updated by the CDO Council and Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) every 24 months.
