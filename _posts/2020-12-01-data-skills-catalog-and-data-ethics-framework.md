As part of the FDS 2020 Action Plan, the General Services Administration (GSA)?committed to complete **Action 13: Develop a Curated Data Skills Catalog (Catalog) and Action 14: Develop a Data Ethics Framework (Framework)**.

* The **[Catalog](https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/fds-data-skills-catalog.pdf)** can be used to help agencies develop competencies for managing data as a strategic asset and making data-driven decisions. 
* The **[Framework](https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf)** can be used by federal leaders and data users as they make ethical decisions when acquiring, managing, and using data to support their agency’s mission.

The Catalog and Framework are [now available](https://resources.data.gov/categories/data-management-governance/) on resources.data.gov. Read and use today!
