**Washington** â€“ In response to the challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19, the Federal Data Strategy team pushed the due dates for two milestones in the 2020 Action Plan back to July 31. Many agencies showed progress on these milestones. A third milestone, originally due in July, was also completed.

Highlights include:

* 24 agencies have selected an operational maturity assessment model for data and data infrastructure.
* Several agencies performed an assessment of current staff data literacy and data skills.
* The National Center for Education Statistics completed the development of a pilot tool that supports automated Information Collection Reviews as well as the identification and export of data elements required for a data inventory.

Achieving milestones builds a solid foundation that will support agencies as they implement the strategy over the next decade. Together, agencies will leverage the full value of federal data for mission, service, and the public good through ethical governance and conscious design.
