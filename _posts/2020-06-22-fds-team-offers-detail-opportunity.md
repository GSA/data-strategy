The [Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov) (FDS), a result of the [*Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset* Cross-Agency Priority Goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata) in the President’s Management Agenda, will fundamentally transform how agencies manage, use, and make data available.

Detail assignments will include completing implementation of the 2020 FDS Action Plan, developing and implementing the 2021 FDS Action Plan, and stakeholder outreach and communications.
