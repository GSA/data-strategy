**Washington** – Today, the Administration released the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan. The Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan is a flagship product of the President’s Management Agenda, and a direct result of Cross-Agency Priority Goal 2 “Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset” led by the Executive Office of the President’s Office of Management and Budget and Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department of Commerce, and the Small Business Administration.

The Federal Data Strategy and 2020 Action Plan will grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, facilitate oversight, and promote transparency. The 2020 Action Plan is designed to be cross-cutting and to support agencies in fulfilling a wide array of legislative and administrative requirements, while also prioritizing foundational activities for agencies in developing a mature data asset management environment. The 2020 Action Plan includes 20 actions aligned into three distinct categories: Agency Actions, Community of Practice Actions, and Shared Solution Actions. 

Federal agencies are reviewing the plan as they prepare to implement the Actions in Calendar Year 2020. Additional resources and events will be rolled out throughout 2020.
