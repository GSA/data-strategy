**Washington** – As we navigate the challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19, the Federal Government remains committed to establishing a solid foundation that will support implementation of the Federal Data Strategy over the next decade. Work on the Federal Data Strategy continues across the government, and agencies are successfully completing many early milestones while meeting the requirements of laws such as the Evidence Act and the Geospatial Data Act.

Consistent with [M-20-16 Federal Agency Operational Alignment to Slow the Spread of Coronavirus COVID-19](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/M-20-16.pdf), the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan is adjusting Actions by extending several Agency target dates by one month and one Shared Solution target date by three months.  In addition, in places where the Federal Data Strategy calls for Agencies to prioritize data assets and projects, the agencies are making sure to include their COVID-19 response as their highest priority. 

Further, the Federal Data Strategy team is collecting data-related COVID-19 news to highlight the use of the Federal Data Strategy best practices in response to the pandemic. Please submit agency cleared and published COVID-19 news to [datastrategy@omb.eop.gov](mailto:datastrategy@omb.eop.gov). 

All COVID-19 adjustments to the 2020 Action Plan can be viewed prominently and in detail at [strategy.data.gov/action-plan]({{site.baseurl}}/action-plan/). 

The Federal Data Strategy team will continue to monitor the pandemic’s impact on agencies and welcome conversations with them about specific concerns they may have in the coming weeks.
