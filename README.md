## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional information.

This site is automatically published based on the branch.

| Branch    | Environment | URL                                                             | Description                                                         |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `develop` | staging     | [strategy-staging.data.gov](https://strategy-staging.data.gov/) | Ad-hoc development and review of significant changes with partners. |
| `main`    | production  | [strategy.data.gov](https://strategy.data.gov/)                 | Production instance.                                                |

Federalist automatically builds previews for all branches. Changes to `main` are
automatically published to [strategy.data.gov](https://strategy.data.gov/).
Feature branches should be branched from `main`.

`develop` is used ad-hoc in order to preview significant changes with partners
and is not part of the development workflow.

### Broken Links

We run a [weekly QA cron job](https://github.com/GSA/data-strategy/actions/workflows/qa.yml) to test for broken links. 

Any errors the QA job finds will be added to the [ðŸ“Œ Link Checker Report](https://github.com/GSA/data-strategy/issues/338).

False positives, or URLs you wish to ignore can be put in the `.lycheeignore` file. This supports regex matching as well.

This job can also be run locally. Install instructions here: https://lychee.cli.rs/installation/

Then run with args: `lychee --base=https://strategy.data.gov .`
