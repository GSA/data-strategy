The Strategy comprises of four components to guide federal data management and use:

1. **Mission Statement**: The mission statement articulates the intent and core purpose of the Strategy.

2. **Principles**: The ten principles serve as timeless guidance to agencies in the areas of: Ethical Governance, Conscious Design, and Learning Culture. These principles informed the development of practices, the 2020 Action Plan, and will also inform subsequent action steps for the Strategy.

3. **Practices**: The 40 practices guide agencies on how to leverage the value of data, focusing on Building a Culture that Values Data and Promotes Public Use; Governing, Managing, and Protecting Data; and Promoting Efficient and Appropriate Data Use. The practices informed the development of the 2020 Action Plan and will inform the development of subsequent action steps for the Strategy. 

4. **Annual Action Plan**: Specify measurable activities to implement the practices and that are the priority for a given year, providing timeframes for implementation and identification of responsible parties.  

Agencies will implement the Federal Data Strategy by adhering to the requirements of the Action Steps in yearly Action Plans in accordance with OMB guidance.
