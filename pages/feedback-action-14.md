## Your Opportunity to Comment on the Federal Government’s Data Ethics Framework

As part of the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan ([Action 14](../../action-plan/#action-14-develop-a-data-ethics-framework)), the General Services Administration (GSA) was tasked with developing a Data Ethics Framework (Framework) that can be used by agency staff, managers, and leaders to help guide the ethical management and use of data throughout the data lifecycle. To develop the draft Framework, GSA collaborated with an Inter-Agency Team comprised of 14 government leaders who are experts in their respective data-focused domains.

**Your Opportunity to Comment:** The GSA is now requesting feedback from subject matter experts, data ethics leaders, federal councils, and the public to further build and refine the Framework. The draft Framework will be available for Open Comment from **Wednesday, September 2nd to Wednesday, September 16th, 2020**.

Your feedback is important to making this resource meaningful and actionable. The final Framework will be posted to Resources.data.gov by December 31, 2020 for use across the Federal Government.

**Questions to consider:**

* What is missing or should be removed from the high-level Tenets? (Section 4: Data Ethics Tenets)
* Are the recommendations for each Data Ethics Tenet sufficient and actionable for federal purposes? Are there additional legal authorities or best practices that should be added? (Section 4: Data Ethics Tenets)
* Do the Use Cases resonate and do the “conversational questions” help to demonstrate the application of data ethics throughout the data lifecycle? (Section 5: Use Cases)
