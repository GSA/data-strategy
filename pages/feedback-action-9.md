The Federal Data Transparency Team is soliciting your feedback on the draft Federal Financial Data Strategy as part of [Action 9](../../action-plan/#action-9-improve-financial-management-data-standards) in the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan.

### Overview

Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are established to drive the implementation of the [Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/pma/). The PMA lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the Federal Government in key areas that will improve the ability of agencies to deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people.

Promoting public trust in the stewardship of taxpayer dollars is woven throughout the Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goals, and is specifically being addresses in support of the CAP Goal: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset.  In June 2019, the Office of Management and Budget issued the Federal Data Strategy which describes a ten-year vision for how the Federal government will accelerate the use of data to support the foundations of democracy, deliver on mission, serve the public, and steward resources while protecting security, privacy and confidentiality.  Building a data-centric environment to promote public trust in financial management, transparency and accountability of Federal dollars
