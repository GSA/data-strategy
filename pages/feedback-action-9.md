## Draft Federal Financial Data Strategy for Feedback

Welcome to the Draft Federal Financial Data Strategy Feedback portal! The Chief Financial Officer Council (CFOC) Financial Data Transformation Executive Steering Committee, with representatives from key agencies specified below, is soliciting your feedback on the draft Federal Financial Data Strategy as part of [Action 9](../../action-plan/#action-9-improve-financial-management-data-standards) in the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan. We have engaged Federal stakeholders and decision-makers to develop the draft strategy to *Open*, *Connect*, and *Demonstrate Value* while promoting public trust in financial management transparency and accountability, in a way that meets user needs while minimizing reporting burden and orienting the business of government around data. 

This information will be used to contribute to a future state of the strategy. **This strategy is a draft and should not be interpreted as setting policy or official guidance.**

### Overview

Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are established to drive the implementation of the [Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/pma/). The PMA lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the Federal Government in key areas that will improve the ability of agencies to deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people.

In June 2019, the Office of Management and Budget issued the Federal Data Strategy which describes a ten-year vision for how the Federal government will accelerate the use of data to support the foundations of democracy, deliver on mission, serve the public, and steward resources while protecting security, privacy and confidentiality. The strategy provides a pathway to guide the Federal Government in building a data-centric environment to promote public trust in financial management, transparency and accountability of Federal dollars.

**The draft Federal Financial Data Strategy seeks to:**

* Open and improve the accessibility of data
* Connect data to support mission and demonstrate performance
* Demonstrate Value, using the spending and performance data to display and report the lifecycle of funding for Federal programs
