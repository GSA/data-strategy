## Your Opportunity to Comment on the Federal Data Strategy Data Skills Catalog 

As part of the Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan ([Action 13](../../action-plan/#action-13-develop-a-curated-data-skills-catalog)), the General Services Administration (GSA) was tasked with developing a Curated Data Skills Catalog (Catalog). The Catalog will help agencies develop competencies for managing data as a strategic asset and making data-driven decisions. To support this initiative, a focus group of data experts from across 9 federal agencies was convened to determine the significant roles in the data ecosystem across the Federal Government and the skills associated with these key functions.

**Your Opportunity to Comment:** The GSA is now requesting feedback from subject matter experts, federal councils, and the public to further build and refine the Catalog. The draft Catalog will be available for Open Comment from **Wednesday, September 2nd to Wednesday, September 16th, 2020.**

Your feedback is important to making this resource meaningful and actionable. The final Catalog will be posted to Resources.data.gov by November 30, 2020 for use across the Federal Government. 

**Questions to Consider:**

* What is missing or should be removed from the data roles?
* What is missing or should be removed from the affiliated skills?
