## How can I provide feedback on the Federal Data Strategy?


We invite stakeholders to provide feedback on the **[draft Year-1 Action Plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/action-plan)**. We accept written comments through various feedback channels, including the Federal Register, web form submissions, and the Federal Data Strategy GitHub site. Stakeholders may also participate in open forums for discussing the Strategy.

There are multiple channels for providing feedback:

* **Federal Register**: You may submit comments via our companion [Cross-Agency Priority Goal: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset Request for Comments Phase 3 (RFC)  on FederalRegister.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USBC-2019-0001-0001).
* **Web form**: You may submit comments on the [draft Year-1 Action Plan page]({{ site.baseurl }}/action-plan/#we-need-your-input-on-the-draft-2019-2020-federal-data-strategy-action-plan) of this website.
* **GitHub**: You may also submit comments via our Federal Data Strategy [GitHub site](https://github.com/GSA/data-strategy/issues/new?template=data-strategy-feedback.md).

Please submit your comment once using your preferred feedback platform.

**Privacy Note**: *The information you submit to this request for feedback may be made public on relevant websites. You should not include any information (e.g., name, email) you do not wish to have publicly available on the Internet. If your submission contains a routine notice about the confidentiality of the communication, your feedback may still be made available to the public.*

### Please submit comments by July 8, 2019.
