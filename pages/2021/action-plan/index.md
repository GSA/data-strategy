# 2021 Action Plan


## Forward

To account for the changing role of data and meet the needs of democracy, the federal government created a coordinated and integrated Federal Data Strategy that better enables data to be leveraged by agencies to deliver on mission, serve the public, and steward resources. Leads from the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Department of Commerce, and Small Business Administration built an interdisciplinary team that worked with private industry, academia, civil servants, and the public to build a robust integrated approach to managing and using data.

The 2021 Action Plan identifies and prioritizes specific actions in support of the Federal Data Strategy, while also recognizing that 2021 is a transition year for the Executive Branch. The focus on the Administration’s immediate priorities[^1] has delayed release of the 2021 Action Plan, which may impact agencies’ ability to complete all of the following identified milestones within the calendar year 2021. Agencies are encouraged to continue making progress on actions and milestones identified in the 2021 Action Plan to the extent practicable. Furthermore, while the foundational activities in the Federal Data Strategy 2021 Action Plan continue to support the President’s priorities, these activities may evolve so that federal agencies can fully leverage data to achieve their mission and deliver to the American public. 


## Introduction

On June 4, 2019 the Office of Management and Budget published Memorandum M-19-18, *Federal Data Strategy — A Framework for Consistency (FDS)*, consisting of a Mission Statement, Principles, and Practices to provide a whole-of-government vision for how agencies should manage and use federal data by 2030. Specifically, the strategy calls for the federal government to replicate, accelerate, and scale government data best practices to:
*	Provide consistent and reliable access to government data to the public, businesses, and researchers for commercial and other public purposes and to fill gaps in government capacity and knowledge;
*	Increase the sharing and use of data for federal decision-making and operational uses;
*	Make federal data more findable and discoverable through rich descriptions and metadata;
*	Utilize data and operational maturity models and evidence-based planning assessments;
*	Provide data management tools and protocols for secure data access for state/local governments; and
*	Plan for secondary data uses from the outset through re-identification risk assessments, stakeholder engagement, and sufficient information to assess fitness for use.

M-19-18 calls for annual government-wide Action Plans to guide Federal agency implementation of the Federal Data Strategy (FDS). Action Plans should “identify and prioritize practice-related steps for a given year, along with target timeframes and responsible entities.”[^2] This approach balances long-term data practice goals across budgets and Administrations with short-term flexibility to adjust for timely national priorities, legislation such as the bi-partisan Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) and Geospatial Data Act of 2018, and adjustment for agency data maturity levels, needs, and capabilities. The 2021 Action Plan was developed in consultation with an interagency, interdisciplinary working group and the newly established Chief Data Officer (CDO) Council Executive Committee. 

To achieve the 2030 Vision of the Federal Data Strategy, annual Action Plans must consider an incremental maturity ladder that generally moves from: **Foundational activities** of governance, planning, and infrastructure (~2020–2022), to **Enterprise activities** of standards, budgeting, and coordination (~2023–2025), to **Optimized activities** of self-service analytics (~2026–2028), to, finally, **Data Driven activities** of proactive evidence-based decisions and automated data improvements (~2029 and forward) (*see Figure 1*). This is an overarching ladder of what the Federal Data Strategy as whole can achieve over the next 10 years to advance data-driven government. Some agencies or portions of agencies may be further along the ladder in 2021 and many Federal programs and offices are actively engaging in **Data Driven activities** today. Agencies that may be able to move more quickly than outlined in the strategy are encouraged to continue promoting enhancement opportunities. However, the goal of the Federal Data Strategy is to ensure that these activities do not happen in a specialized or ad hoc way, but rather are integrated into agency culture and become standard practice across all federal government programs.

The 2021 Action Plan builds on the outcomes of the 2020 Action Plan in the foundational activities of governance, planning, and infrastructure, with a long-term vision in mind. During 2021, CDOs continue to grow in their new capacity and lead each agency to fulfill ambitious but achievable goals to better serve the public.

## Looking Ahead

The Federal Data Strategy, presented in final form in OMB Memorandum M-19-18, articulates a ten-year vision for how the federal government will accelerate the use of data to deliver on mission, serve the public, and steward resources—while protecting security, privacy, and confidentiality. Fully implementing the 40 practices described in the strategy will require a sustained, iterative, and systematic effort over a ten-year period. The Action Plans will continue to identify priority actions each year and incrementally build on progress annually, capitalizing on the successes of previous efforts, aligning with ongoing federal government programs and policies, incorporating applicable emerging technologies, and complementing new statutory requirements.

The 2021 Action Plan builds on the 2020 Agency Actions and affords agencies the flexibility to complete actions not fully met in 2020, as well as to move forward in their Foundational activities. This year’s Action Plan also focuses on Shared Solutions and Community of Practice actions that further cross-agency enterprise data maturity and common approaches to data. In this manner, the 2021 Action Plan provides the next step towards completing the Foundational phase of the FDS. The lessons learned from 2020 also create an opportunity to consider how the timing of future Action Plans can better align with existing planning cycles, as implementation of the FDS continues over the ten-year period.

Future annual Action Plans will further develop a coordinated and collaborative approach to Federal data stewardship. The newly formed CDO Council will continue to foster information-sharing and cross-agency collaboration among CDOs. Sustained cross-council collaboration will facilitate interagency partnership. Feedback from stakeholders will continue to highlight key topic areas for future annual Action Plans. These plans will build on the progress made by agencies and the CDO Council in advancing FDS’ mission: to leverage the full value of Federal data, in alignment with American values, for mission, service, and the public good.
