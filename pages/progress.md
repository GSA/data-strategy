## 2020 Action Plan Progress

The Federal Data Strategy provides a common set of data principles and best practices. 

The [2020 Action Plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/action-plan) identifies milestones that are essential for establishing processes, building capacity, and aligning existing efforts. This initial plan builds a solid foundation that will support implementation of the strategy over the next decade.
