## Resources

The Federal Data Strategy working group team is committed to providing agencies with as many resources as possible to execute the Federal Data Strategy successfully. To that end, in addition to creating a new suite of federal enterprise data tools, the team has created and curated specific resources to support implementing Agency Actions. 

Have a related resource suggestion? Please send it to [DataStrategy@omb.eop.gov](mailto:DataStrategy@omb.eop.gov) for consideration.  

For additional support to improve federal data management use, agencies are encouraged to use and contribute to the resources available on [resources.data.gov](https://resources.data.gov/)—an online repository of policies, schema standards, tools, best practices, and case studies managed by GSA, OGIS, and OMB.
