	<h2>2020 Action Plan Progress</h2>

	<p>The Federal Data Strategy provides a common set of data <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/principles/">principles</a> and best <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/practices/">practices</a>. The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/action-plan/">2020 Action Plan</a> identifies milestones that are essential for establishing processes, building capacity, and aligning existing efforts. This initial plan builds a solid foundation that will support implementation of the strategy over the next decade. This page will showcase progress, measurements, and metrics collected and reported on 65 milestones from 20 actions. We will track progress on the 2020 Action Plan milestones continuously throughout the year. As milestones are completed, information will be uploaded to this page. Once this page is fully operational, you will be able to check agency activity on every milestone.</p>

The project is comprised of two phases: an exploratory phase (phase 1) and a development phase (phase 2). Phase 1 including research, focus groups, and stakeholder feedback from academia, private and public sector have been conducted to pilot a prototype of the Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) tool, an open-source questionnaire fashioned after the Canadian Algorithmic Impact Assessment.
