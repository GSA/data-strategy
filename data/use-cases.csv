The USPTO has made available public patent and trademark bulk data (https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/bulk-data-products).  The availability of this data  has not only enabled more meaningful access for the public, but also has served USPTO with valuable tools from the commercial sector developed using this public data to improve the examination process when searching for prior art. The USPTO supports this ecosystem with timely releases of patent information in various formats through their Bulk Data products (https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/bulk-data-products). Several important data products are distributed through third parties (PAIR data from Reed Tech) or new systems (PEDS) as a result of historical technical limitations. The USPTO should continue to unify their data distribution methods for providing both efficient incremental updates and the full datasets.The USPTO has also focused on applying Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning to patent search tools to increase internal process efficiency and make data accessible for building Machine Learning models.  For the public community, the research datasets and projects by the USPTO Office of the Chief Economist have been invaluable in making new data available for the first time (the Office Actions dataset), as well as releasing previously-public data in easy-to-use formats for Data Mining and Machine Learning (the PatentsView project). The timeliness of updates to these datasets is not as important because the data is used for infrequent training of models that can be applied to new inputs, or for academic research that can tolerate delays.When developing new applications, collecting and storing metrics on their usage and performance is important to guide and evaluate future improvements. These metrics from internal applications, such as search queries and results clicked on, can also benefit the agencies' goals of applying Machine Learning to improve their systems by training models on these metrics.(https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets)  A key element of enabling this involves linking USPTO data with other international data formats.  Developing uniformity of patent numbering with patent offices internationally would be critical to the USPTOs goals here.   Information not directly produced by the USPTO can still be important to measuring patent quality and the patent system's effects. The Patent Litigation Docket Reports Data (https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/electronic-data-products/patent-litigation-docket-reports-data) collects information from PACER about patent cases, which can be used to study patents used in litigation. The USPTO should continue to collect external data.""When researchers studied administrative and other data in connection with Oregon's Medicaid expansion, they found enrollment was associated with lower depression rates, higher ER use, and no significant change on employment. Submitted by: J-PAL North America.","Understanding the Impact of Expanding MedicaidUsing administrative data, researchers studied the expansion of Oregon’s Medicaid program to inform one of the most salient political debates of the last decade: the impact of providing health insurance to the uninsured. The state of Oregon’s decision in 2008 to allocate application slots in its expanded Medicaid program by lottery offered researchers an extraordinary opportunity to understand the causal impact of the program by comparing the outcomes of lottery winners to lottery losers. In addition to a survey of lottery winners and losers, researchers measured outcomes for over 20,000 individuals using administrative data sources such as hospital records, employment data, and state and federal benefits records. The administrative data allowed researchers to discover a key finding that would have otherwise been obscured by fading memories: When researchers surveyed lottery winners and lottery losers about emergency room use, they found no statistically significant difference. However, by looking at Portland-area hospital records, researchers found that Medicaid increased emergency room use by 40 percent. Other outcomes measured included health care utilization (use of preventive care and emergency services increased), financial strain (catastrophic expenses and other measures decreased), mental health (depression rates declined), physical health (perceptions of health improved, but measured physical health did not detectably change), and employment and earnings (neither improved). Measuring all of these outcomes for both lottery winners and losers would have likely been impossible through surveys alone. ""When the U.S. Census Bureau collects business data from various sectors and governments, then companies are able to compare their operations to industry norms, find new markets, and inform key decisions. If the Brazilian government creates five-year projections of specific regions and skill sets to select the best provider of a training curriculum, then they will be better able to meet emerging manpower needs. When the Department of Commerce’s Economic and Statistics Administration publishes economic indicators daily, then retailers are able to use neighborhood-level demographics to maintain their inventory across the country.

Submitted by: The Third Sector.","Concept Note: Paying for Outcomes Across Workforce, Education, and TrainingTHE OPPORTUNITYSeveral recent legislative changes have created a unique opportunity over the next nine months. States having a combined SNAP E&T and Workforce plan can use existing Dept of Labor authorities as part of their outcome-oriented project design for SNAP E&T eﬀorts. At the end of the nine-month period, the Pay for Success project can use the ﬁrst expenditures from the $100M Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act (SIPPRA) fund. To access those funds localities need to have completed a feasibility study. We recommend that FNS sponsor Technical Assistance (TA) to 5 states to determine the feasibility of Pay for Success projects for Education and Training in preparation to utilize SIPPRA funding. Even if only three of the cohort sites are funded, the FNS TA money will be ampliﬁed 15 times by the SIPPRA funds.SNAP E&TThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) currently spends over $300 million on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment and Training (SNAP E&T) programming nationwide and up to$1 billion in funding allocated by FY2021. While states are required to administer SNAP E&T programs, they have a large degree of ﬂexibility in deciding whom to serve and which services to provide. Many states are interested in increasing the work requirements for receiving beneﬁts across multiple federal beneﬁts programs. There is a limited understanding, however, of the eﬀects of disparate program models and components—and their long-term eﬀects on participants’ lives.The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity ActIn 2014, Congress and the Department of Labor (DOL) included key provisions in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) to catalyze local innovation and outcomes-oriented approaches to workforce programming. WIOA Pay-for-Performance (P4P) guidelines now allow workforce boards to set aside funds that will not expire during the traditional two-year funding cycle if they are tied to the achievement of long-term outcomes that measurably improve people's lives. These P4P payments could incentivize workforce providers to meet longer-term performance objectives, such as sustained increases in employment, wage growth, and academic achievement, and reductions in the need for utilization of public beneﬁts and time spent in the justice system.This shift away from compliance and towards longer-term outcomes through the authorization of P4P contracts, has created an unprecedented opportunity for government to build on the history of performance-based contracting to develop more comprehensive services, and deploy resources in increasingly outcomes-driven ways. Generous funding from the Social Innovation Fund (SIF) allowed Third Sector to work with ﬁve jurisdictions to ultimately launch the nation’s ﬁrst two WIOA P4P contracts in Northern Virginia (2017) and San Diego County (2018).Combining Funding StreamsJurisdictions shifting to outcomes-oriented programming can utilize the P4P provisions in WIOA to reward achieving long-term workforce and education outcomes while covering service delivery costs with SNAP E&T funds. Using WIOA authorities would allow states to shift to an outcomes-orientation from compliance-focused programming without requiring changes to current USDA authorities. Starting in 2016, states could submit plans to align state workforce strategy across federal programs through DOL, EDOE, HHS, HUD and USDA. Already, nine states have combined WIOA eﬀorts with SNAP E&T through joint plans, including Washington, Minnesota, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Virginia, and Massachusetts.Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act (SIPPRA)The 2018 Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act (SIPPRA)1, for the ﬁrst time, establishes a funding stream and structure to support and advance the implementation of Pay for Success contracting impacting Federal outcomes and related costs. The joint SNAP/WIOA P4P initiatives can leverage this$100 million fund available to state and local governments to pay directly for program outcomes, project feasibility studies, evaluation, and program administration. The authority to review and approve proposals sits with the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the newly formed Federal Interagency Council on Social Impact Partnerships. SIPPRA has the potential to transform the way states think about the provision of human and social services and reduce in the need for federal support by ﬁnding real solutions to the most persistent challenges.PROPOSED SCOPE OF WORKThird Sector proposes providing TA on Pay for Success to 5 states that have implemented combined SNAP/WIOA plans. The cohort would include a diverse range of states and agencies that are at diﬀerent points in the process of aligning workforce programming across diﬀerent funding streams. Through the proposed scope of work, states would develop a comprehensive P4P contracting strategy, a prerequisite for utilizing WIOA’s P4P provisions and for accessing the SIPPRA funding.Third Sector has deep experience in the workforce development and job readiness training programs and has been a national pioneer in partnering with government to implement P4P. We are excited by the opportunity to launch another cohort focused on coordinated outcomes-oriented contracting across the SNAP E&T and WIOA programs. The following section outlines the work required to demonstrate how outcomes-oriented SNAP E&T programming would operate. The overall work would be split into two phases over the course of 15 months with the following goals:Phase 1: Assess Phase (6 months, 5 sites plus a learning Community, $1.0 - $1.25M)● Prepare a plan for accessing the SIPPRA funding for Phase 2 and for matching success payments● Create an engaged coalition among government partners to launch a joint WIOA/SNAP P4P pilot project in 5 states that have combined SNAP E&T/WIOA plans or that otherwise demonstrate readiness for a P4P collaboration● Develop a data-informed understanding of the population to be served at each site, the referral pathway, and the outcomes to be delivered by the pilot using existing administrative data such as Unemployment Insurance, National Student Clearinghouse, and/or income tax ﬁlings.● Identify evidence-based or a novel theory of change to achieve desired outcomes and agree on a roadmap for integrating the appropriate service provider, data, and contracting support for launching the pilot1 http://www.americaforward.org/practice-policy-sippra-little-known-legislation-big-implications/ The Assess Phase will end with a deliverable that solidiﬁes a vision of the engaged stakeholders’ goals, the shared understanding of a pilot project, and the roadmap for implementing the pilot.Phase 2: Build Phase (9 months, funded separately)● Transition the Assess Phase vision and deliverables to a realized project● Address any gaps identiﬁed in Assess Phase and build out outcome-oriented contracts/grants with the state agreements oﬃcers● Launch 2-year pilot projects with robust evaluation plan in at least 3 statesAt the end of the Build Phase, processes and contracts will have been ﬁnalized to operationalize an outcomes orientation through the pilot.Phase 1 and Phase 2 require active participation and leadership from staﬀ and government partners (including departmental decision-makers and staﬀ) to collaborate with Third Sector on these work streams and provide access to program information and data. Working with states that are committed to improving outcomes by implementing new approaches that connect reimbursement to improvement in the lives of those receiving services is critical.Assess Phase Scope of WorkThe cohort model has demonstrated the value of starting in several communities at the same time. Each state learns how others addressed their challenges and they provide feedback on how to scale nationally. The move to outcome-orientation requires changes across the contracting, ﬁnance, services, and data systems. Our experience has shown that this is diﬃcult to accomplish and to get multiple sites to Phase 2, a cohort size of three to ﬁve is needed at the start of the Assess Phase. There are several reasons why moving to outcome-orientation is not practicable in all sites immediately, and the cohort model makes it likely that at least one site will be ready at the end of the Assess Phase.Each cohort member develops a plan to meet the local need using the best local providers. A detailed work plan is included in the table below. Success payments are used to scale projects by rewarding the most eﬀective providers. The project design must work within constraints on data access, community need, and contracting regulations and a rigorous evaluation framework. As an example of a full project, the SkillSource Group of Northern Virginia used WIOA P4P to revamp their outreach to youth exiting the foster care or the justice system. If providers meet the same performance metrics with these historically underserved groups, they get a roughly 10% bonus to further expand nontraditional outreach.While the sites develop their plans, the learning community will share best practices within the cohort and also provide USDA with insight on the best path to expand outcome-oriented approaches to more states. This pilot program can help FNS build a nation-wide plan to improve the outcomes of those they serve by rewarding providers who make positive changes in people’s lives.Work Stream DeliverableKickoffThird Sector will review and ﬁnalize the engagement work plan, including timelines and responsibilities for all parties. This eﬀort will ● Project Work Plan● Information and data request identify the needed government decision-makers, programmatic experts, and data integrators to support the execution of the work plan. ● Pilot goals and vision, including rosters for Steering Committee and Working Group(s)Beneficiary PopulationIdentify speciﬁc eligibility criteria for need, referral, and enrollment of beneﬁciaries.

This deliverable will synthesize the vision for the pilot, prioritize challenges in structuring the pilot, identify programmatic and administrative conditions for launching the pilot, and conﬁrm that a Q2 CY19 launch of the pilot is feasible. It will also include a recommendation on how best to apply and win Build Phase support from local sources and SIPPRA funding.Build Phase Scope of WorkThe build phase would be funded separately from this initial project design work. Only those sites where the assessment showed that the pilot would be practical would move forward into this phase. The goal of the Build Phase is to create the concrete agreements needed to launch the pilot project. These agreements include the service contract, the evaluation plan, and other data use agreements as needed to execute the evaluation.If desired, support for the build phase could be built into the overall TA agreement with funding as an option on the Assess Phase contract. For those states that are ready to move to the Build Phase, the option can be exercised, and the Build Phase work can start independent of an award from SIPPRA.TIMING, STAFFING AND BUDGETMost engagements commence within 6-12 weeks of contract signing in order to mobilize key stakeholders and align Third Sector resources to engagement needs. During this period Third Sector requests the key information and contact info from key stakeholders. In this way, we are able to build momentum quickly once the engagement formally starts. Once the project has begun, we ask that the TA-recipients continue supporting the Steering Committee and working group teams with their internal teams requiring about 50% FTE.Our team typically works at the state’s site at key points throughout an engagement with most daily work done in the Third Sector oﬃces. Staﬃng for each site includes a Director (10% FTE) who will serve as the Relationship Manager and Senior Project Resource, a Manager (50% FTE) who will serve as the Project Lead and runs daily management of the project, and an Associate (50% FTE) who will provide ongoing engagement support.In addition, the Learning Community has an additional team with a Director at 10% FTE and a Manager and an Associate at 50% FTE each to coordinate with the sponsor and facilitate the cross-site Learning Community and long-term scale-up plan for FNS. In a 6-month engagement, there is typically one in-person cohort meeting and two virtual gatherings using video teleconferencing.Third Sector is on the GSA schedule (NAICS Code 541618) with established rates and volume discounts. A 6-8 month Assess Phase program at our established rates and applying a 5% volume discount has an approximate price for 5 sites and the Learning Community between $1M and $1.25M. ABOUT THIRD SECTORThird Sector Capital Partners (“Third Sector”) is a 501(c)3 nonproﬁt consulting ﬁrm that advises governments, community organizations, and funders on how to unlock public sector innovation to solve pressing challenges such as economic mobility for all and the well-being of our children. Our proven approach is to collaborate with our clients to deﬁne impact, draw actionable insights from data, and implement outcomes-oriented contracting. In the past six years, we have worked with over 40 communities that embrace the challenge of becoming more eﬀective, eﬃcient and transparent with taxpayer dollars.Together with our partners, Third Sector has helped launch ten outcomes-oriented contracts that transition over $360 million in total public funding towards positive outcomes. Third Sector has launched an initiative to create system-wide impact in America’s workforce development ﬁeld by designing nationally scalable, performance-driven contracts. Beginning with partnerships in Austin, Boston, Denver, Northern Virginia and San Diego, Third Sector is taking advantage of the unique and time-sensitive opportunity resulting from enabling guidelines recently passed in the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.Using SIF federal grants, Third Sector has created two issue-based cohorts of TA recipients–one focused on two-generation outcomes for children and families and the other on WIOA–to promote peer-to-peer learning and eﬃcient scaling of outcomes-oriented contracting.To select sites for these cohorts, Third Sector held a national competition and selected local governments to receive TA over the course of twelve months to design, implement, and scale P4P initiatives. In addition to site-speciﬁc technical assistance, sites in Third Sector’s cohorts participated in learning communities that featured joint trainings, workshops, and webinars focused on outcomes contracting strategies.Please contact Brian Beachkofski (bbeachkofski@thirdsectorcap.org, 937-626-2650) for more information or any questions.""If public sector executives at agencies working with electronic evidentiary information embrace best practices related to cloud solutions, they will reap benefits in storage, recovery, management, and compliance.

Developed in 2016, the CJARS is an integrated data repository policymakers use to improve public safety, save money, and minimize legally- and socially-imposed penalties. SCPS hasn’t been updated in almost 10 years. Submitted by: University of Michigan.","Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS) Use CaseWe propose a Use Case that updates the dormant Bureau of Justice Statistics State Court Processing Statistics program (SCPS) using CJARS as a model.The Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS) is a new integrated data repository designed to fundamentally transform research and reporting on criminal policy in the United States. CJARS collects longitudinal electronic records from police, sheriffs, courts, and correctional agencies and harmonizes these records to track a criminal episode across multiple stages of the justice system. Disparate local records are harmonized into a common national format, and probabilistic record linkage identifies all events associated with a specific individual and reconstructs the sequence of criminal justice activities in response to a given offense. In partnership with the US Census Bureau, these records can be merged with extensive social and economic information and form the basis for a new permanent federal CJARS repository accessible to all qualified researchers.CJARS has been in pilot development since Fall 2016, during which we have collected criminal justice data on over seventeen million people in nine states, covering more than forty-nine million criminal justice events. These include data on arrests and bookings, case filings and dispositions, and spells of jail, probation, prison, and parole. We have developed a data schema and governance infrastructure with the ability to scale nationally. In order to build stable relationships with data providers, CJARS will provide regular statistical reports to agencies using linked survey and administrative records.A central goal of CJARS is to give policymakers tools to make data-driven decisions about criminal justice and non-criminal justice programs. Scientifically informed policy can direct more efficient spending to improve public safety, save money, and minimize collateral consequences. In this spirit we would like to propose restarting the dormant Bureau of Justice Statistics State Court Processing Statistics program (SCPS), which has not been updated in almost a decade, using CJARS as a Use Case in the Data Incubator Project.Features of CJARS make it particularly attractive for producing the SCPS.  An existing and growing cache of historical administrative records would enable the production of retrospective statistical series for previous dormant years as well as benchmarking relative to prior methods.  Additionally, linking with Census data would support the integration of socio-demographic characteristics from surveys and other administrative records that might not otherwise be feasible.CJARS is only two-years old, so it does not currently have national level coverage. It is a long-term project, designed from the ground up to be sustainable and generate real value for data providers. But SCPS was never a national data collection. And given the time since it was last completed, we think a pilot-level program across 10-20 states could be useful, and generate momentum for CJARS as a critical part of the federal statistical system. The permanent structure of CJARS will also allow SCPS to continue to be produced in a timely manner.A reincarnated State Court Processing Statistics series with regular updates could transform how these data are used to inform a number of critical policy questions in the United States. Detailed local information on criminal activity over time could help build models on the scope and trajectory of the opioid epidemic. Sentencing information could be used to compare policy and its effectiveness across states. Detailed supervision histories could be used in sampling frames to improve coverage of hard-to-capture subpopulations. Integrated criminal histories could be used to develop population-level profiles of interactions with the criminal justice system. Together, we believe both the direct and secondary applications of a CJARS-supported SCPS will strongly advance the public policy interests of the United States.""If data relating to gun violence or made more available, researchers would be better-placed to help policymakers curb harm in this policy area. Submitted by: American Institutes for Research.","Studying Gun Violence on Social MediaAccording to CDC, every day in the United States, close to 40 people are killed by guns (not including suicides). According to a 2016 study, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher than the rate in 22 other high-income nations.Increasing numbers of researchers are asking questions about the causes and patterns of gun-related violence in the United States. However, the lack of research data is highly limiting. Better availability of data would help researchers develop a descriptive understanding of the issue, thereby improving policymakers’ ability to craft evidence-based policies to respond to and ultimately reduce gun violence.AIR has developed a social media monitoring framework and dashboard that is connected to real-time data streams to filter and collect information that users post about “gun violence” topics online (Figure 3). Beyond data collection, the tool allows the capture of any changes in the social media space; that is, it identifies those changes as events or new trends by extracting relevant descriptors from the text data to continuously update which posts become part of the research dataset. Availability of these data creates opportunities for further research, such as network analysis to identify influencers of grassroots movements, sentiment analysis to detect differences among stakeholder groups, and user identification models to map out the diverse set of institutions, individuals, and other groups active within this policy arena.""When researchers worked with H&R Block, they found that a streamlined aid process improved access to college for individuals with limited means. Submitted by: J-PAL North America.","Simplifying Financial Aid ProcessesThrough access to national-level data on college enrollment and financial aid, researchers found that a streamlined aid process improved access to college. Researchers partnered with H&R Block to conduct a large-scale randomized evaluation of the impact of providing financial aid application assistance to low-income adults and dependent children from low-income families.  For recipients in the treatment group, H&R Block pre-populated some aspects of the free application for federal student aid (FAFSA) and provided personalized assistance and information about financial aid options. Compared to a control group that received a basic brochure on college financial aid, treatment group individuals were more likely to submit the form and receive aid, as measured in U.S. Department of Education data.

In recent years, policymakers have increasingly called for simplifying the financial aid process, and a White House report cited this study as the most direct test of the impact of reducing complexity in the financial aid application process.""The Veterans Affairs Center for Innovation (VACI), the Dean Center for Tick Borne Illness at Spaulding Rehabilitation Network/Harvard Medical School Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, MIT Hacking Medicine, and the Open Medicine Institute are collaborating and sharing data to help solve challenges in the prevention and treatment of Lyme disease. The Patent and Trademark Office’s open data platform is showcasing unique ways data can be combined with other data sets, such as economic and geographic data. A collaboration between NIH, the UK-based Welcome Trust, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and The Open Science Prize inspired prototypes of tools, products, and services using open digital content to solve public health and biomedical challenges. By sharing weather data, NOAA helps lower the economic and human costs of weather-related damage.

Submitted by: Anonymous.","Case Study: Data Integration Innovations to Enhance Analytic Utility of Clinical Trial ContentProject Data Sphere (PDS) is a research platform that provides the research community with broad access to both de-identified patient-level data from oncology clinical trials and related analytic tools. While these data are rich in measures that characterize the clinical trials under study, data providers are required to de-identify patient-level data by removing key demographic data. To address these analytic constraints, the data profiles in selected PDS patient-level cancer phase III clinical datasets have been augmented by linking the social, economic, and health-related characteristics of like cancer survivors from nationally representative health and health care-related survey data. Using statistical linkage and model-based techniques, patient-level records in selected PDS datasets have been linked to those of comparable cancer survivors, and are thereby augmented with survey content on social, economic and health-related characteristics. These new analytically enhanced PDS data resources enable more targeted analyses designed to examine questions such as how disparities in cancer patients’ access to health care and income impact patient outcomes in specific phase III clinical trials, and what variations in patient outcomes are associated with specific demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors. This case study provides an overview of the methodologies used to connect patient-level clinical trial data with nationally representative health-related data on cancer survivors from the national Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). MEPS was designed to provide national population-based health care use, expenditure, and source of payment estimates in addition to measures of health status, demographic characteristics, employment, health insurance coverage, and access to health care. Study findings include probabilistic assessments of the representation of the patients in the respective clinical trials relative to the characteristics of cancer survivors in the general population. The study also demonstrates how the augmented datasets serve to enable researchers to assess the impact of socioeconomic factors added through data integration on cancer survival and related outcomes of interest. Summary: Cancer researchers continue to advance discoveries and treatment protocols, yet every year, millions of lives are lost to cancer. Solutions are not advancing quickly enough. Researchers work independently and must often compete for resources needed to carry out their work. Project Data Sphere, LLC (PDS) was formed in 2012 to catalyze cancer research by bringing together diverse minds and technologies to help unleash the full potential of existing clinical trial data. PDS, an independent initiative of the CEO Roundtable on Cancer’s (CEORT’s) Life Sciences Consortium, operates a first-of-its-kind research platform. PDS provides the research community with broad access to both de-identified patient-level data from oncology clinical trials and freely available analytic tools to assist them in analyzing those data. A primary goal of PDS is to advance new research efforts that will improve the lives of cancer patients and their families around the world (Abdallah et al., 2015; Greene et al, 2015). These data are rich in measures that characterize the clinical trials under study, treatment protocols, and patient outcomes. However, to address the confidentiality provisions inherent to the trials, data providers are required to de-identify patient-level data prior to uploading datasets to ProjectDataSphere.org by masking or removing certain demographic data.

Submitted by: USDA.","USE CASE PROPOSAL: Census-USDA Joint Project linking Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) administrative and Census data: Linked Census-SNAP administrative data were used to produce sub-State estimates of access to SNAP among eligible households in Texas and New York. Census’s American Community Survey has a large sample size that can be used with SNAP administrative data to provide SNAP access rates for demographic subgroups and counties within States and subgroups within some large counties. Census is using this method to estimate sub-State SNAP access for States that share their administrative data with Census. The information helps SNAP administrators understand and better target households who may be eligible but not accessing the program.Current and future work using the Census-USDA administrative data platform includes the projects listed below. These projects and other potential analysis scale up the initial linkages by expanding the number of states, adding new administrative data to assess a broader set of programs, and providing analysis for specific groups such as veterans. o Since all SNAP participants are income-eligible for WIC, linking SNAP administrative data to WIC administrative data allows us to accurately identify infants and children who were eligible for WIC program but did not enroll.  Knowing the demographic characteristic characteristics of those who receive WIC benefits and those who, among eligible individuals, do not is important for assessing and improving program performance. Special focus is given to infants and children inasmuch as eligible infants are more likely to participate in WIC than eligible children.o SNAP administrative records provide a valuable tool to examine spells of benefit receipt because they capture the universe of SNAP recipients and contain information on the duration and amounts of benefits.  How long do individuals receive SNAP benefits?  What individual, household, and environmental characteristics distinguish long-term from short-term recipients?  What is the incidence of isolated short spells versus repeated cycling on and off SNAP? The use of administrative records will help overcome the problems of under-reporting and spell censoring found in survey data.o A future project could estimate SNAP’s poverty-reducing effect using a monthly timeframe, which better captures how SNAP benefits reduce poverty. The project links data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to SNAP administrative data from several States to accurately identify (a) SNAP participants, (b) the particular months in which SNAP benefits were officially issued, and (c) the dollar amount of SNAP benefits. The analysis complements other ERS research that uses the Current Population Survey to measure the effect of SNAP in reducing annual poverty.o Linking administrative records with survey data holds the potential for improving understanding of food security and food insecurity among veterans.  With approval by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), administrative data already provided by VA and currently held at the Census Bureau can be linked with USDA’s Food Security Supplement to the Current Population Survey to examine prevalence, severity, and trends of food insecurity among veterans and their households.  The project plans to distinguish the experiences and conditions of working-age veterans from those of retired veterans.    ""If wage data from participants in social programs is compared before and after enrollment and against control groups, program effectiveness can be evaluated. Submitted by: Johnson County, Kansas.","Evaluating social programsLocal governments and nonprofit organizations are in need of quantitative analyses on effectiveness of the social programs that are implemented with the intention of helping people become self-sufficient. Examples of such social programs include educational and job training programs in local jails and state prisons, psychological and medical treatments at community based mental health services, and stabilization assistance provided by human services departments. Comparing short- and long-term individual wage data before vs. after people participating in a program, or between program participants vs. a control group would provide statistical evidence in terms of program effectiveness. For example, a group project at an Applied Data Analytics Workshop (https://coleridgeinitiative.org/training) found that 61% of prisoners did not earn any wage during the 8 quarters after being released from prisons. This finding, although preliminary, alarmed leaders of the state prison system, because the large amount of fund invested in educational and job training programs in prisons did not bring about the intended outcome: helping people obtain employment after they exited prisons. This preliminary study was conducted inside NYU Administrative Data Research Facility (https://coleridgeinitiative.org/computing), a secure cloud computing environment that hosts individual wage data (among many other micro-data sets) and provides software for data analysis. All steps of data manipulation, visualization, and analysis are done inside the secure environment, and permission to export final results is granted only after content passes security inspection.""If city- and metropolitan-level economic trends are scaled, along the lines of Kansas City's work with NYU, it could allow for better forecasting nationwide.

Submitted by: Palantir Technologies.","There are several examples from the Federal Government’s current data product offering that illustrate the value of a central repository that prioritize ease-of-use and compatibility:• Data.gov is an example of a central repository for the metadata of U.S. government data products. This portal provides links to open, machine readable formatted datasets hosted by various federal agencies. Within Data.gov’s data catalog, end users can search for datasets using different criteria.• The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) is a central repository for U.S. and international economic indicators. FRED hosts 509,000 time series, including macroeconomic data like GDP and inflation, from 87 sources, including central banks from around the world. End users can access these data through FRED’s web-based user interface or its API service.• The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) is the world’s largest repository of weather and climate data. It hosts data from land based, marine, satellite, radar, weather balloon, and paleoclimatic sources. The Federal Government should develop a pilot data product that embodies the principles and best practices of Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset. For example, the government could develop a central portal for data relevant to first responders in natural disasters. This portal could integrate weather data from NCEI with population data from the Census Bureau. This product would aid in disaster response by enabling first responders to better predict the impact of natural events and allocate resources more efficiently. At the same time, this repository could provide the data provenance for each data series that it hosts; a common, machine-readable format for outputs; and ensure the security and confidentiality of the underlying data (and metadata).Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset will allow the Federal Government to better govern and increase the effectiveness of its data products. The principles and best practices outlined in the strategy and in the comments above will make the government's data products more valuable and more accessible. Without affecting utilization, these structures will also protect the security of the data and the underlying confidentiality of respondents. Finally, researchers, managers, investors, and policymakers will be able to make more effective decisions based on these improved data.""If the Administration publishes federal management guidance in machine-readable data formats instead of documents, using the United States Legislative Markup (USLM) language, it would achieve the Cross Agency Priority goal of shifting from low-value to high-value work. Submitted by: Data Coalition.","Cross Agency Priority Goal 6, “Shifting From Low-Value to High-Value Work,” seeks to establish “regular processes to assess the burden [of OMB’s management guidance] on agencies and to rescind or modify requirements over time.” That is, the Administration should recognize the central role of documents in government data and encourage the application of modern “data-first” technologies for authoring documents and begin the process of defining a data standard and strategy specifically for guidance documents.ACTION:The Administration should publish federal management guidance in integrated, machine-readable data formats instead of documents. The Data Coalition’s work to pursue open data for laws and mandates provides a use case for exactly the same transformation, starting with Congressional laws, bills, and amendments. The United States Legislative Markup (USLM) provides an excellent framework for such a standard, and is already used for bills, laws, and applications within the United States Code and the Code of Federal Regulations.INTERNAL BENEFITS:By treating federal policy documents as data, and establishing standards for the drafting and interoperable dissemination/issuance of such documents, management and the agencies can more readily understand how policies integrate with existing policies and therefore work to comply more readily. Furthermore, executive leadership will have the ability to smartly and efficiently draft and issue policies while being able to measure compliance and successful realization of intended effects.EXTERNAL BENEFITS:The public and Congress will be able to more readily and fully understand the specific directives currently guiding and constraining agency programs and leadership. This will help guide and inform public policy conversations while further building trust in government. ""When Veritas deployed Data Insight at a large federal agency, it helped the agency distinguish between data necessary to run the agency and redundant, obsolete, trivial data. Submitted by: Veritas.","Use Case 1: Veritas deployed Data Insight at a large Federal agency to help them understand their stored data. The findings showed the following.- 58% of their data was dark, meaning that it hadn’t been accessed in over thirty-six months and had no owner in Active Directory.- 31% of their data was ROT (Redundant, Obsolete and Trivial) and had not been accessed for between one and three years.- 11% o4f their data was active information needed to run the agency.The agency took actions based on the intelligence it received from Data Insight. Veritas’ Integrated Classification Engine was used in conjunction with Enterprise Vault to scan the data and then, through policy, move it from primary storage to other cheaper storage areas seamlessly, with no impact on the end users. For example, the dark data was moved to Amazon Glacier. All sensitive data was moved to a long-term storage device with an automated seven year retention policy. The organization’s most important data was moved to high-speed, primary storage. This data strategy resulted in a much lower primary storage footprint, which moved a large amount of data out of their backup environment.The agency also used Data Insight to understand user behavior. At one point, this allowed the agency to detect a user copying a large amount of data that was outside of their normal workday. While the incident was minor, it could have been the prelude to a data breach. Data Insight gave them the tools to detect this behavior deviation.As a tangential benefit, the agency was now in position to start an eDiscovery practice using Veritas’ eDiscovery Platform. The eDiscovery Platform allowed the department to search all of their storage locations, email, SharePoint, desktops and other loose file locations for data that pertains to a particular matter. They used this tool to answer FOIA requests and legal searches. In the past, it took four or five days to respond to a small or medium sized request and redaction was almost impossible. With the eDiscovery Platform in place, they were quickly able to respond and redact in at least a third of the time.Legal hold matters were also an issue. They needed a tool that could notify and track users that were required to be on legal hold. They were tracking this on a spreadsheet. Now they had a tool that could create, monitor, track and escalate legal holds automatically. This freed up the time of one of their supervisors to do other work. Lastly producing data was streamlined for the FOIA and legal departments by placing all their search and redaction results into easy to configure and use files that could be sent to FOIA requestors or the legal team for their needs.

Two years ago, the Department of Education launched the Cognos integrated data dictionary. Submitted by: Department of Education.","• 4½ years ago, as FSA began to develop an enterprise data warehouse (EDW) covering the full student aid lifecycle, an integrated data dictionary was planned from the very beginning. • The goal was to have analysts using common definitions in their queries & reports, with the ability for them to toggle directly to metadata within the warehouse without having to consult separate Microsoft Word or Excel documents.• Originally, the primary user interface to the warehouse was through the Cognos BI tool.o Creation of a Data Dictionaryo Dictionary is a user tool covering the data contained in the warehouse -- not intended as a product to cover all of the data elements in Federal Student Aido To include information such as:- The data source (both go-forward (“regular production”) and back-filled history)- aggregation level of the data element- student aid programs and years covered by the data element usability tips “tricks of the trade” informationo To integrate a guide to data values for commonly-used elements, including where the available values change over timeo To document FSA data standards and data definitions which have been established over time (and used for reporting, analysis, DRT requests, etc.) but that have not typically been documented in the pasto Data dictionary and data standards were intended to be updated as changes occur in student aid programs, policies, reporting, and source systemso Due to the huge scope of data content, the project initially focused on commonly-used warehouse tables, such as “Roll Up” tableso The process requires manual compilation of metadata• In August 2016 we launched the Cognos integrated data dictionary. We usually call the integrated data dictionary “IGC,” an acronym for the IBM software application: Information  Governance Catalog.• Warehouse users can right-click on a data element or table in Cognos and then select “Glossary” to enter the IGC. Once authenticated, IGC users also have the option to navigate via a URL to IGC production, which offers a fully-searchable interface. Content editors have additional access to click into IGC development.• In addition to providing the ability to toggle directly to dictionary content from within the warehouse, the IGC version of the data dictionary offers far more content than the warehouse vendor’s Excel data dictionary deliverable. • For data elements, here are some examples of the metadata:o Data level (such as whether the data element is person-level, loan level, grant level, school-level or servicer level)o The specific student aid Programs applicable to the data element)o Years available (generally the time-frame when regular processing of the warehouse has been in place, although some elements/tables store most-recent-month only)o Prior Data (indicates whether there are data available from before regular processing began, for example data from backfill and history dump)o Issues (includes data quality)o Usability and Availability (examples include tips and tricks for using the data)• At the table level, IGC also includes descriptive information which is applicable to the table as a whole.• There is a one-to-one relationship enforced between the warehouse data model and IGC. In other words, there are no data elements and tables in IGC which are not in the warehouse.• However, in April 2017 I added a Reference Addendum capability which is available to store useful information not specific to an individual data element or table. This allows for content in IGC which (1) applies to multiple tables or elements or (2) serves as reference for those who are running or writing various reports and dashboards. Examples include:o Changes over time in valid values for data elementso Full listings of valid values for selected key data elements• Possible future enhancements includeo An enterprise-wide data dictionary -- including source systemso Direct toggle access for warehouse users who are not using Cognos""If support is provided for Leidos to collect veteran suicide data from the VA Open Data Portal and Census, it will leverage its Global Monitoring and Planning System (GLIMPS) to compare rates of suicide in rural vs. urban areas. Submitted by: Leidos.","Use Case: Veteran Suicide MappingPreventing suicide among America’s veterans is a high priority both at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and within the current administration. At Leidos, our mission is to make the world safer, healthier, and more efficient through information technology, engineering, and science. We offer this use case for Veteran Suicide Mapping in support of this mission and in support of America’s veterans.Twenty veterans commit suicide every day according to a 2018 analysis [1]. In fact, peacetime veteran suicide, which used to be well below the rate of the general public, rose above the civilian rate for the first time in history in 2008 [2]. It is a high priority at the VA to provide care to all veterans, regardless of their geographic location. In particular, a new presidential executive order directs the VA, Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security “to collaborate to provide, to the extent consistent with law, seamless access to mental health care and suicide prevention resources for Veterans” [3].According to a 2016 research report on veteran suicide, there is a need for “comparison of suicide rates for residents of urban and rural areas” [4]. We propose mapping veteran suicide at the census tract level. This enables the VA to 1) identify areas to deploy additional mental health services, 2) identify veteran suicide groupings and map their location by classification (i.e., urban, rural, and highly rural), and 3) determine the scope of the problem when considering mental health care availability in urban versus rural areas (e.g., it may be necessary to deploy more Community Care resources to certain rural and semi-rural areas). For this geospatial data analytics use case, we will collect veteran suicide data from the VA Open Data Portal [5] and census tract data for urban, rural, and highly rural areas from the U.S. Census Bureau [6].

Submitted by: Summit.","Data Incubator Project Use Case SubmissionThere are more data collected on military veterans throughout their lives and careers than perhaps any other segment of the American population. The Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and state-level unemployment offices (UI), among others, independently track valuable data. Unfortunately, these data, and the wealth of knowledge they collectively contain, are unlinked. Our Data Incubator Project Use Case proposes to link the data together for the first time in a comprehensive, longitudinal dataset on veterans. The formation of cross-agency data-sharing agreements and the corresponding research possibilities will help veterans’ agencies collaborate at a new level of efficiency and effectiveness.The Data Incubator Project can expect the following returns on investment for our Use Case:• Increased data efficiency and capacity for veterans’ agencies. Cross-agency information sharing is currently unformalized and slowed by bureaucratic gridlock. Our Use Case will streamline data collaborations. At the end of Year 1, we expect to have an operational data warehouse accessible by multiple veterans’ agencies.• More impactful research. Currently, researchers note that veterans’ data are often difficult to access and/or to link to other data. Studies are limited to cross-sectional snapshots of one set of veterans during one time-period. Our Use Case will transform research possibilities through richer historical data and repeated observations on veteran activities and outcomes. We expect many of today’s correlational studies to be tomorrow’s causal impact evaluations. Year 1 will have an initial exploratory analysis. Year 2 and Year 3 will produce rigorous evaluations on the new longitudinal dataset.• Automated, self-sustaining data tools. The ultimate measure of success for our Use Case is its sustainability among federal collaborators. We will provide detailed, hands-on trainings to agency representatives to ensure that collaborators are proficient with the operation of the data warehouse. Throughout the project, we will ensure that that federal agencies can implement the data processes, replicate the tools, and perpetuate the project going forward.In Year 1 of our Use Case, we will develop memoranda of understanding, formalize cross-agency data sharing agreements, and complete an initial descriptive analysis on the data. At the end of Year 1, we expect to have an operating data warehouse and research hub. In Year 2 and Year 3, we will finalize research questions, study designs, and conduct the first evaluations and impact studies using the longitudinal data. They will use the descriptive analysis of Year 1 as a foundation. From Year 1 through Year 5, we will create and automate data dashboards for participating agencies and prepare recurring public use data files. We will conduct frequent trainings with federal agencies to sustain the effort and increase capacity for future data collection and evaluation. By the end of Year 5, we expect the data warehouse, data dashboards, and research projects to be self-sustained by the federal government.Our proposal team consists of agency leadership at DOL’s Veterans’ Employment and Training Services (VETS) and Summit Consulting, along with VA and DoD transition agencies. VETS, VA, and DoD bring unparalleled subject matter expertise on military service records, employment services and outreach to veterans, and benefits after military separation; Summit Consulting brings industry-leading data science capacity and more than 10 years’ experience evaluating federal programs. We anticipate that our Use Case will require roughly $400,000 annually.""When the Bureau of Transportation Statistics launched a curation project for the statistical data it creates, it supports the Federal Data Strategy's four strategic areas in various ways.

Submitted by: Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.","IntroductionUnderstanding the impact that education and training programs have on individuals’ employment outcomes and economic mobility is a crucial need for federal, state, and local policymakers, as well as the private sector, for a variety of reasons, including policy and practice improvement, identifying strategies for better serving students and workers, and making wiser investments with public dollars.Yet the disjointed data systems governing these sectors make using data intelligently to inform these purposes extremely difficult.The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) proposes a voluntary data use case that would inform the Federal Data Strategy through improved Use, Access, and Augmentation of existing data resources, leading to better Decision-making and Accountability by expanding a federal state partnership to better use federal and state data.The use case would allow states to take advantage of existing federal data collections to turn siloed data into actionable insights about postsecondary education and training programs. It would do so by providing aggregated outcomes data on employment outcomes back to states. There is currently an example of this usage in the partnership between the U.S. Census Bureau Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics program and the University of Texas system. This process could be scaled, expanded, and automated in ways that allow states and systems to receive custom aggregations.Additionally, there could be a statistical engine employed in the system that could carry out basic econometric functions without allowing access to the individual-level data. This use case could create an effective data partnership that would leverage existing resources and transform research offices across the country overnight while also protecting student privacy and enhancing data security. This would fill major gaps in state data and allow policymakers at the state and federal levels, local workforce training boards, and colleges and universities to have a much clearer understanding of the connections between training and education and employment.BackgroundThe federal government, as well as state and local governments invest substantial tax dollars in education and training. However, there are no comprehensive data sources that are capable of following students through the education or training pipeline and into the workforce (and back and forth, assuming some degree of “swirl” among many students) should these students cross state lines.The data all exist, yet their siloes require Rube Goldberg-esque data linkages to comply with legal requirements, satisfy political concerns, and settle “turf” disputes. In some states, and for some research questions, this may not matter, but for others, particularly states with large urban areas or institutions of higher education near a border, this limits the utility of their data system. Relatively straightforward questions – such as, how much STEM majors earn upon graduation from college, or how well state policies designed to improve college success and prepare students to meet future employer demand are working – are answerable to some extent if states have good data systems, but must include a litany of caveats about students and workers who may have crossed state lines.Finally, as America’s workforce grays, more jobs require postsecondary credentials, and a new round of automation takes flight, questions arise about providing enough trained and educated workers and ensuring that future students can adapt to the next “new economy,” where success is likely to be predicated on the ability to learn and adapt. Yet our policymakers at both the federal and state levels cannot use their data systems to learn how to prepare the next generation of America’s workforce.Expanding the Concept of the Census LEHD Postsecondary Employment Outcomes Partnership One potential solution that would bridge these data system gaps is to broaden the availability behind the concept of the partnership between the Census LEHD and the University of Texas System. To simplify this partnership, the UT system provided individual-level data on students, including institution and program. Census used this file to look up employment data on students and provided back customized aggregated data. Results are available here:https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/pseo_beta.html.This initial result has been well received by employers, policymakers, and throughout the postsecondary research community and is an excellent example of what can and should result from thoughtful partnerships between governments, the private sector, and higher education. But now, we should think about how to do more. The concept is excellent, but there are several additions and enhancements that would improve the utility of this type of partnership. The ideas are sketched out in general below. It should be noted that these ideas are agnostic to the source of employment information. In fact, the federal government has repeatedly used other sources of employment data for transactional uses (such as verifying earnings for financial aid eligibility) or research and reporting purposes (such as the College Scorecard). Thus, the general term “employment data source” is used, which likely means the Census LEHD collection, but could also refer to Department of Treasury data.The Federal-State Data PartnershipThe Federal Government could establish a secure process through which entities (state agency or system researchers) who have entered into a standard data sharing agreement could supply individual level data with social security numbers and additional custom data elements. The system could then  retrieve employment information from a federal employment data source as well as potentially other relevant federal education data (such as information on student loans) to construct a research dataset in a secure environment.Research staff from the entity would not be able to access individual level data (except, perhaps for data elements they submitted), but the system would have analytical tools available through which users could carry out simple analytical processes (aggregations on certain variables, ratios, basic regressions, etc.) This suite of tools could be similar to the Datalab offered by the National Center for Education Statistics (https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/index.aspx).Currently, states are working through numerous different avenues to cobble together data resources with limited effectiveness that would answer key questions in a similar fashion as this potential tool.This partnership could immediately replace WRIS, WRIS II, SWIS, WICHE’s Multistate Longitudinal Data Exchange, a good portion of the College Scorecard, and numerous bi-lateral data sharing efforts with more complete and more accurate information.Clearly, this would be a complex undertaking, but it could be implemented incrementally. This work would leverage existing resources and the heavy previous investments that states and the federal government have made in longitudinal data systems.Data SafeguardsAny new data use presents potential risks to data security and student privacy. First, this system would be voluntary, so no state agency or system would be required to participate. Those that do would likely be providing a small amount of data.The most important safeguards would be to ensure that the aggregate data and/or analytic results coming out of the system do not compromise the privacy of any individuals. The Census (as well as other federal agencies) have extraordinary expertise in this area. Through limits on access, the number of related queries that can be conducted with a dataset, and the procedures developed through its partnership with the University of Texas System, this challenge can be overcome.Results from this Use CaseThis use case would transform the postsecondary education and training landscape. The range of existing tools and dashboards designed to provide consumer information could be replaced with clear and consistent measurements. Students and their families could understand not only what the benefit of enrolling in certain programs at a school might be, but also what the debt load might look like. States will be better able to understand how their policies are working as they administer federal programs to train new workers in emerging industries and provide employers with the workers they desperately need. Institutions could better understand the relationship between their academic programs and student services and skills development. Employers could more readily identify talent pipelines that fuel growth and profitability.Unlike proposals to create a federal student unit record system (on which our organization remains neutral) this proposal would provide usable information to state leaders by allowing them to create the custom analyses they need.Ultimately, such a data system would make federal investments in Pell Grants more efficient, by giving states an improved ability to analyze not just outcomes for Pell students, but how well their own policies interact with Pell grants and how that combined suite of policies impacts students in the long run (further bolstering the concept of a federal-state partnership). Additionally, this would allow economic development and workforce training agencies working near state borders to better understand how their efforts might complement one another or be redundant, again improving the efficiency of both federal and state investments.WICHE’s Role and Next StepsWICHE recognizes that the comments provided here are only a surface level treatment of an extraordinarily complex (but extraordinarily powerful) tool. WICHE has years of expertise working with states on issues relating to cross-state data sharing through the development and implementation of our Multistate Longitudinal Data Exchange, a system that links individual-level identifiable education and employment data across state lines. As noted above, WICHE remains neutral on the creation of a federal student unit record data system, as has been envisioned in numerous proposals (most recently through the College Transparency Act). This neutrality comes with a caveat that if the federal government elects to construct such a system, we strongly believe that it must take into account states’ needs (and current proposals fall short on this measure because they do not allow for states to create custom disaggregations).Our expertise certainly does not match that of Census staff and others in the federal government, but our data team stands ready to assist if this concept is deemed worthy of further exploration. WICHE can convene a team of state data staff and state policy leaders from across the country, as well as nongovernmental organizations, academics, and others to further discuss the concept, especially the components that would require state agency participation (such as the construction and submission of state data files).""If the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) leverages NYU's Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF) to provide broad access to its data, it would help researchers derive important insights.

The project would house the 2008-2018 Information Resources Incorporated (IRI) food store scanner date and USDA’s National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) data. Although ADRF is secure and FedRAMP approved, ERS will ensure that all regulatory aspects of security are met to provide the efficient and effective access protecting the privacy and covered.  The project will build a modern governance structure to provide efficient and effective access along with disclosure risk review processes.  Because these data are complex, an important dimension of promoting the use of the data for program evaluation and efficiency as well as research is to expand and develop the community of existing and new users.  Therefore, the strategy to widen use and usability for decision-making and accountability targets building communities with similar interests. ADRF will design and manage training for to expand and develop such users. One important community is state agencies that operate and manage food assistance programs.  ADRF and ERS will seek a partnership with USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service under which a number of states and their staff will be selected to be trained by empirically examining a set of well-specified questions, developed in conjunction with those agencies, with the goal of creating new tools and approaches that would improve food assistance program management and operational efficiencies.  Another important community are academic power users. They will be invited to use the system and provide guidance and comments on usability.  The ADRF team will also create a series of scholarships for junior researchers to access and use the data in the ADRF environment.The public is another important community.  However, a more efficient approach, other than training, is needed to tap into the latent information, including for commercialization.  The ADRF team will provide the leadership to investigate initiating an innovation competition to develop applications that can analyze and summarize the data across varying entities, generate estimates for a variety of variables of interest, and display the results visually, graphically, and in table form.  The ADRF will bring together key stakeholders to determine what the important variables are, the potential products and the structure of the competition.""When agencies implement Enterprise Data Governance, they facilitate timely research supporting decisions and course corrections. Submitted by: Enterprise e-Support.","Homeland Security Use caseThere are use cases in law enforcement and Intel communities where stakeholders are hard pressed on time to research data related to a subject or an event and make decisions and/or make course corrections. A situation involving a suspect, or special operations or war fighting, may demand actionable data, on time. At such time, a smart organization will know where their data is, what it means, and how it is connected to a variety of data domains. In the government, legacy application portfolio and reports are the only way to gain visibility into data. The reality is, users questions cannot always be answered via application views. Data analytics is a primary user function for decision making and it must happen in a self-service manner. At Enterprise e-Support, Inc. (EeS), we believe, knowing where data is, and what it means can resolve a lot of problems. With Enterprise Data Governance, the stakeholders and the data architects can build an enterprise level taxonomy using common vocabularies such as NIEM and map all enterprise  data assets into it for sub-selection and visualization of enterprise data. This sub-selection or querying of data can happen in a self-service manner. It also important that Enterprise data governance happens all the time. EeS solution supports governance groups deal with ongoing changes to database portfolio and ingest them into the taxonomy as they happen. This ensures the queries generated automatically via enterprise taxonomy and mappings are accurate. A self-service query generation, execution, and business Intelligence culture will strengthen data stewardship because stakeholders now know how data is organized. Increased familiarity with data structure and relationships within data assets will help stakeholder mark sensitive data to its distribution. Elements that cannot be mapped to the enterprise taxonomy could be obsolete objects, stale or duplicate copies of data. Removal of obsolete objects and stale copies of data will optimize data environment. This may also help agencies progress towards a single source of data. The above approach also provides for a mechanism to build an enterprise data warehouse (EDW) for BI. With all the lineages and data context known, it is easier to select data for specific goals and provide necessary data and critical data points via EDW. Architectural visibility of data layer not only facilitates fast access to data, it also helps generate impact reports involving other layers. Governance of touch points such a what business function accesses and/or creates data via which systems or service and is hosted on what digital resource can be very useful in understanding the mission holistically. Use of common vocabularies will not only help with data sharing inside the agency, it will also help with information exchanges with external partners. Enterprise e-Support is also modeling its solution to include auto generation of classifications and data assets mappings. It is further developing solutions for automation and accountability by using immutable block chain for data sharing. The application is delivered via AWS public cloud and also tested for readiness on government-approved mobile private cloud in case a  special operations and/or war fighting team needs it on their vehicles and/or trailers and stay connected with team data via satellite access. With the above, we believe we can assist with all 4 data strategy areas, Enterprise Data Governance, Use, Access and Augmentation, Decision making and Accountability; and Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use.  Below are some screenshots of EeS Enterprise Information Management (EIM) Solution to build taxonomies, mappings and sub-selection and visualizations.Enterprise Data GovernanceClassification, Mapping, Policies (Standard Vocabularies, Updates to Enterprise Taxonomy)<Diagrams excluded>Visualizations<Screenshots excluded> Use, Access and Augmentation Sub-selection and Query Generation: <Screenshots excluded>Decision making and AccountabilityThe above query is executed in analytics environment and data visualizations are generated via open source BI tool packaged with the solution.

Submitted by: Anonymous.","Early Childhood Use CaseNumerous studies have found that high-quality early childhood programs, birth to age 5, can greatly help children in poverty fare far better in life.  Perhaps most well-known among those studies is the Perry Pre-School Study (https://highscope.org/perrypreschoolstudy), a randomized control trial done in the 1960’s. Subsequent studies have yielded similarly positive findings. See, for example, http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~deming/papers/Deming_HeadStart.pdf) about the Head Start program, which serves over 900,000 children in poverty every year.Unfortunately, little is known about which programs and practices are likely to work better than others, especially for different children and different domains of learning (e.g., literacy, numeracy, social-emotional). Is the High Scope program, created to replicate the Perry Pre-School practices, better or worse overall than some of its competitors, such as Creative Curriculum and Frog Street?  If it is better overall (on average), is it also better in each domain?  Similarly, is it better for all children or do other programs work better for children with certain characteristics (e.g., learning styles)?  Is the success of some programs likely to vary by parent characteristics (e.g., language spoken at home, drug dependency)?  Little is known, too, about whether current programs have improved over time, and, more important, how they can be improved further.Despite an abundance of data being gathered and supplied annually or more often by Head Start and other programs and reams of research, it is surprisingly and distressingly difficult for early childhood providers to learn from their own and others’ experience which curriculum and practices (e.g., absentee-reducing) work well and, especially, which are likely to work better than others in different situations. Similarly, despite valuable research on adverse childhood experiences, current data systems do not provide early risk warnings to detect modifiable stressors in the home nor support priority-setting.  In short, it is far too hard to identify, objectively, lower cost, higher return ways to serve the nation’s most vulnerable children.A big part of the problem is the way early childhood data are gathered, shared, and analyzed.  For example, although Head Start programs gather data at the child level, they report it to the federal government only at the grant recipient level.  This is, in part, because the federal government is not allowed to gather child-level data. Others could combine child-level or classroom data, but few currently do.  The lack of child-level data makes it hard to look across programs using different curriculum, such as High Scope and Creative Curriculum, or different practices, such as absentee reduction or book-reading campaigns, to look for patterns, similarities, and relationships that will help those on the front line working with children and their families understand what is likely to work better for children with different experiences, learning styles, or other characteristics.  This absence of insights is true even in the few states starting to develop kindergarten assessments. Another problem for the 1600 Head Start providers is that they use several different programs to collect data for different purposes – such as administrative recordkeeping, attendance, teacher assessments, and child progress assessments. For all but a small subset of Head Start providers, the systems used to collect these data cannot currently communicate with one another, even within a single center. This makes it excruciatingly difficult to sense, for example, how attendance problems might be affecting a child’s progress.  Nor does it make it easy to detect patterns, such as when absenteeism goes up and whether some teachers have lower absentee levels than others. If it did, it would support discovery of programs and practices with greater potential to reduce problems.  Another problem is that the vendors providing Head Start assessment programs do not make it easy to compare children and programs in similar circumstances (e.g., language, rural) across locations to look for positive outliers who might be doing something that, if replicated, would yield similarly favorable results in other locations. To address these problems, the National Head Start Association, serving the 1600 Head Start providers, launched the Data Design Initiative in late 2017 to make early childhood data more useful. See https://www.nhsa.org/our-work/initiative/data-design-initiative for a description of the initiative, the problems that led to its creation, and projects underway. NHSA has embarked on a multi-stakeholder effort, involving Head Start providers, current and potential suppliers/vendors/trainers, multiple levels of government, and others in the non-profit and research community to generate greater insights from early childhood data to enhance results for Head Start children and their families.  Working with this federal cross-agency priority goal team would likely reveal new methods and data sources for harvesting more meaning and better outcomes using existing, refined, and evolving early childhood and related data sets. ""When South Carolina launched an Integrated Data System, it made it easier for the government and independent evaluators to assess the impact of government programs. Submitted by: J-PAL North America.","South Carolina’s Integrated Data SystemSome systems and infrastructure can be put in place to enable lower cost and more efficient research. An integrated administrative data system across government agencies is one such model that makes conducting randomized evaluations (and other forms of evaluation) more efficient. For example, the integrated data system South Carolina has built over time, which is housed at the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, has made it easier for the government and independent evaluators to assess the impact of government programs. This has made South Carolina a promising location for researchers interesting in answering crucial policy-relevant questions. As just one example, South Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services (SCDHHS) has partnered with J-PAL affiliates to evaluate how expanding the Nurse-Family Partnership through a pay-for-success contract affects the health and long-term economic outcomes of mothers and children enrolled in the program. The integrated data system South Carolina has built has been a crucial foundation for enabling a cost-effective, reliable evaluation design. From the perspective of the research team, it has been very helpful to work with a central entity (the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, or RFA) for a number of reasons: ● clear data documentation and standard data request processes are in place.● staff are in place to receive data requests and shepherd them through the data use agreement process.● RFA can enable linkages across data sets from different departments and agencies and coordinate the data use agreement process. This is particularly important in cases where we are evaluating programs that may affect people’s lives across multiple outcomes in ways that do not match the silos of government agencies. ● This administrative data infrastructure enables us to measure the impact of the program without incurring the cost and the burden on study participants of following up with surveys and original data collection.● This example also highlights the value of having similar coordination at the federal level that would enable data access across states and across different federal sources of data.""If the National Association for State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) and similar organizations were leveraged to share enterprise data governance practices, it would help make data sharing and oversight between federal and state governments easier.

Submitted by: NY United Methodist Church.","COMPREHENSIVE AND ACTIONABLE DATA ON THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC:  HARNESSING CONFIDENTIAL MICRODATA TO BUILD A NATIONAL OPIOID SURVEILLANCE DASHBOARDThe country is in the midst of a rapidly shifting opioid overdose epidemic. In 2016, 1 in 65 of all US deaths were opioid related – opioid overdoses now claim more lives per year than HIV/AIDS did at the height of the epidemic. For every fatal overdose, an unknown but large number of individuals suffer from chronic opioid abuse and non-fatal overdose, with devastating individual and societal consequences. The face of the epidemic is also evolving and shifting in ways that challenge traditional epidemiologic surveillance methods—from prescription opioids in 1999-2010, to heroin in 2010-2013, to illegally manufactured synthetics like fentanyl currently. To support effective, forceful and nimble action to quell the opioid overdose epidemic across the United States, it is essential to harness the rich trove of confidential microdata on the opioid supply and on indicators of opioid-related harm to improve national capacity to reliably track its evolution, predict where and who it will affect next, and identify new and promising interventions.  Timely access is needed to comprehensive and geographically granular data over time on: (1) state- and local-level laws, policies, and services that may impact opioid-related harm; (2) indicators of the shifting legal and illegal drug markets; and (3) measures of opioid overdose and associated outcomes.  While multiple disparate efforts have assembled data on the opioid overdose epidemic, no single national database resource of requisite depth and scale exists at this time. Building such a resource would advance the Department of Health and Human Services’ 5 Point Strategy to Combat the Opioids Crisis, by addressing Point 2: Better Data. A national Opioid Epidemic Surveillance and Response Dashboard (OESRD) can integrate novel and existing data sources addressing: (1) laws and policies that regulate the prescription opioid supply and mitigate opioid-related harm (e.g., prescription drug monitoring programs, pain clinic regulations, prescription limits, naloxone access laws, overdose-related Good Samaritan laws, state restrictions on opioid treatment programs, and Medicaid coverage of medication assisted treatment); (2) access to opioid use disorder services and medications (e.g., overdose education and naloxone treatment programs, opioid treatment programs, clinicians with DEA DATA waivers to prescribe buprenorphine, treatment admissions for opioid use disorders, retail sales of naloxone and medication assisted treatment); (3) opioid supply (e.g., opioid prescribing and dispensing patterns, heroin price and purity, fentanyl and heroin law enforcement seizures); (4) opioid use, overdose, and related outcomes (e.g., opioid overdose-related deaths, opioid-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits, survey reports of opioid use, misuse and disorder); (5) social, economic, and physical environment factors associated with opioid overdose risk (e.g., high school graduation, unemployment, inadequate housing); and (6) compiled evidence on what works to prevent and treat opioid misuse, overdose, and opioid use disorders, the strength of such evidence, and examples of where prevention and treatment approaches are being implementedSpecific emphasis should be put on acquiring data that are:  1) granular, 2) front-line, 3) as close to real-time as possible; and 4) integrated across diverse sources and multiple levels of geographic resolution (as applicable), including states, counties, metropolitan statistical areas, cities, census tracts, and census blocks. An OESRD can provide a secure platform to host multiple datasets using confidential microdata, including hospital discharges, vital statistics, prescription retail sales, and drug seizures, among others. The platform can be dynamic, enabling government agencies to add confidential data as soon as it becomes available, and promoting collaboration across government agencies, universities, and community leaders, among others. Analytic, mapping and visualization tools can be embedded and made accessible online, and public versions of the data can be offered in easily downloadable, user-friendly spreadsheets to meet the needs of diverse constituents.  Building high-quality, public-facing dashboards to meet the needs of multiple stakeholders is a complex endeavor and requires a team with substantive relevant experience.The OESRD would allow community members, health professionals and policymakers at all levels, spanning rural and urban settings, to access timely data to identify trends in prescribing patterns, drug markets, and opioid overdoses, identify emerging geographic areas of risk, define targeted strategies to markedly reduce overdose rates, and track progress towards reaching strategic goals. At the national level, it would equip policymakers and researchers with the tools to track and anticipate the evolution of the opioid epidemic, to identify geographic and socio-demographic groups at highest risk, to refine hypotheses about key drivers of the epidemic, and to evaluate the effectiveness of current approaches to this public health crisis.

Submitted by: Rubrik.","USE CASE - DAVIES WARD PHILLIPS & VINEBERGA typical example of a fast-moving organization that was attracted to the cloud is Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg,a large international law firm. Davies Ward believed cloud would allow the firm to invest in its core business ratherthan in IT. The firm’s IT staff had begun the transition away from legacy IT infrastructure by replacing old backuptapes with virtualized infrastructure and wanted to move more aggressively to the cloud.“Our previous solution wasn’t meeting our SLAs,” said Evans Vogas, the firm’s network operations analyst.“Backups were going longer than the backup window,” he said. “Second, replication did not work very well in ourprevious solution; it would create a backlog and require manual cleanup. It was also incredibly complex to set upand manage, especially archival to public cloud. You had to be a rocket scientist.”To help manage the transition, the firm turned to Rubrik. Quickly, according to Vogas, the firm saw numeroustangible benefits: TCO was reduced by half, data efficiency improved by a factor of 7, the physical data centerfootprint was cut by 91%, and RPOs were reduced from the previous 12 hours to just minutes.By using Rubrik for backup, disaster recovery, replication, public cloud archival and test/dev across physical, virtualand cloud environments, the firm was able to modernize its IT framework and cut costs in the process. Archiving,in particular, was a workload where Rubrik helped the firm move aggressively to the cloud. “We had been lookinginto public cloud archival for over a year, but the ones we found were complex to set up,” Vogas said. Onerequirement with Rubrik was that it had to work easily with any public cloud. “Since Rubrik encrypts data sent tothe cloud, you are protected,” he said.""When the State Department implemented MeterNet, a smart-metering platform for collecting real-time utility and facility equipment data, they began saving $32K annually at each site and reduced hundreds of thousands in annual travel costs by enabling engineers to conduct remote performance audits.If the State Department uses its automated MeterNet utility data for predictive analysis, they will be able to forecast equipment failures months before they may occur, prevent catastrophic failures, and extend the lifespan of equipment by reducing frequency of replacements and related costs.    When the State Department, in partnership with the science community and EPA, implemented DOSAir, a network of air monitoring sensors that reports hourly on the air quality conditions of nearly 40 posts, they were able to begin developing health messaging and standard operating procedures for U.S. personnel and citizens living abroad whose health is increasingly threatened by air pollution. If the State Department combines its automated DOSAir air quality data with NASA satellite data and applies machine learning to forecast air pollution, then U.S. personnel and citizens abroad can reduce prolonged exposure.  When the State Department implemented Telematics, a secure sensor network that automatically collects data from Department vehicle computers, they could apply centralized analytics to: review fleet performance, reduce costs by identifying anomalies in vehicle performance such as dangerous driving and fuel theft, predict maintenance needs to extend vehicle lifespans, determine which vehicles are best suited for each post, and profile the safety record of each fleet driver for managers.

Submitted by: City of Kansas City, MO.","Vacancy in housing is a major problem that influences blight and economic distress. To effectively address vacancy, however, requires understanding where it is occurring. As a dynamic phenomenon, it can be hard to track and understand over timeThe City of Kansas City, MO has endeavored to achieve a better understanding of vacancy on a static, snapshot basis, but could be better positioned to focus resources on areas with higher vacancy if we could track it as it occurs. Local utility data (water/sewer) provides one set of insights into potential vacancies, but needs to be cross-referenced with another set of data to distinguish lack of water use that is due to vacancy as opposed to other factors (i.e. water theft, broken meters). The USPS vacancy data is utilized by many cities in some format, but is hard to obtain access to. Setting up better access to USPS data that would allow for cross-referencing with other vacancy-oriented administrative data at the city level would allow cities to obtain a much better real-time understanding of the dynamics of real estate and residents in their city, and react with the appropriate resources.""When the Department of Homeland Security spearheaded the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM.gov),  a common approach to multi-agency data sharing for the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Health and Human Services, they were able to build interoperable extensible data standards for multi-agency counter-terrorism and law enforcement projects.If the Federal Government endorses NIEM as the government-wide default for data standardization, in coordination with OMB and GSA, they may be able to build interoperable extensible data standards for multi-agency projects, beyond counter-terrorism and law enforcement. Submitted by: Data Coalition.","The federal government has very few data formats for sharing mission or programmatic related data across multiple agencies. One prominent exception is the Department of Homeland Security lead National Information Exchange Model (NIEM).To build a common approach to multi-agency data sharing, the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Health and Human Services created the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) (see: https://www.niem.gov/), which publishes a data dictionary of common fields (the ""NIEM Core"") and helps agencies create formats using those fields. (In the summer of 2017, version 4.0 of the NIEM Core will incorporate the Legal Entity Identifier.) NIEM is now used extensively to build formats for multi- agency counter-terrorism and law enforcement projects, but has tremendous potential for use beyond these mission areas.ACTION:The Administration should consider endorsing NIEM as the government-wide default for data standardization and publication projects. The Administration should explore moving the NIEM management team (three-five full-time equivalents) into a government-wide leadership office such as OMB. In coordination with the data standardization work of GSA’s US Data Federation (an outgrowth of the Data.gov effort) and Project Open Data, NIEM stands poised to foster a base of standardized material data to inform the natural harmonization of common mission data within agency environments.INTERNAL BENEFITS:Adopting a NIEM-first policy for federal mission or programmatic related data sharing projects will ensure that agencies at least consider reusing the common data fields of the NIEM Core, rather than building their own, when they initiate data exchanges.EXTERNAL BENEFITS:The broader use of the NIEM Core will enable serendipitous reuse of federal open data at a far greater scale. ""If the Federal Government regulatory agencies form a Task Force led by Commerce Department’s Trade Finance Advisory Council to implement the Standard Business Reporting (SBR) data standards and new technologies like distributed ledgers, they may be able to reduce compliance cost savings to the private sector like Australia and the Netherlands have.  Submitted by: Data Coalition.","U.S. regulatory agencies employ document-based forms to collect information from the private sector. However, the concept of Standard Business Reporting (SBR) demonstrates that regulatory agencies can reduce the compliance burden on the private sector by replacing forms with standardized data, governed by common data standards across multiple regimes. Australia and the Netherlands have implemented SBR, with their regulatory agencies agreeing on a common data structure of common fields and formats for the information they collect. As a result, Australian and Dutch business software can automatically compile and submit regulatory information to multiple regulators at once, saving compliance costs.In April 2018, the Commerce Department’s Trade Finance Advisory Council (TFAC) recommended to the Secretary of Commerce that the federal government should pilot and implement a standardized reporting regime similar to the SBR concept (see: https://www.datacoalition.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/07/TFAC_Data-Standardization_Final.pdf). The TFAC’s recommendations provide an opportunity to move forward.ACTION:The Administration should convene a task force representing all major regulatory agencies to create a road map for standardizing the data fields and formats that they use to collect information from the private sector, modeled on best practices learned from foreign success cases like the Australian Standard Business Reporting project, to reduce compliance costs. The task force should evaluate ways to deploy new data reporting technologies, particularly distributed ledger/blockchain, throughout U.S. regulatory reporting. The Administration should consider a role for the Department of Commerce in the housing and leadership of the task force as recommended by the TFAC.INTERNAL BENEFITS:Although the full implementation of a U.S. SBR program would require a multi-year effort, the creation of an exploratory task force would help scope out the required policy barriers and necessary investments, and encourage regulatory agencies to voluntarily begin regulatory data standard setting work where applicable.EXTERNAL BENEFITS:The adoption of SBR in the U.S. has the potential for enormous regulatory compliance cost savings to the private sector. For instance, Deloitte has estimated that Australia's SBR program will have accrued$5 billion AUD in compliance cost savings to the private sector by the end of 2018 (see: https://comms.dfsco.com/LP=1923).""If LEHD data is integrated with local and regional transportation data, there could be more robust and timely ""Access to Jobs"" metrics to inform federal decision-making and transit initiatives, such as autonomous vehicles, to empower vulnerable populations with frictionless mobility.

At Leidos, our mission is to make the world safer, healthier, and more efficient through information technology, engineering, and science. We offer this use case for Veteran Suicide Mapping in support of this mission and in support of America’s veterans.Twenty veterans commit suicide every day according to a 2018 analysis [1]. In fact, peacetime veteran suicide, which used to be well below the rate of the general public, rose above the civilian rate for the first time in history in 2008 [2]. It is a high priority at the VA to provide care to all veterans, regardless of their geographic location. In particular, a new presidential executive order directs the VA, Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security “to collaborate to provide, to the extent consistent with law, seamless access to mental health care and suicide prevention resources for Veterans” [3]. According to a 2016 research report on veteran suicide, there is a need for “comparison of suicide rates for residents of urban and rural areas” [4]. We propose mapping veteran suicide at the census tract level. This enables the VA to 1) identify areas to deploy additional mental health services, 2) identify veteran suicide groupings and map their location by classification (i.e., urban, rural, and highly rural), and 3) determine the scope of the problem when considering mental health care availability in urban versus rural areas (e.g., it may be necessary to deploy more Community Care resources to certain rural and semi-rural areas).  For this geospatial data analytics use case, we will collect veteran suicide data from the VA Open Data Portal [5] and census tract data for urban, rural, and highly rural areas from the U.S. Census Bureau [6]. After aggregating and refining the data, Leidos will leverage our Global Monitoring and Planning System (GLIMPS), which is currently being used by America’s intelligence and special operations communities to predict global hotpots at a 96% accuracy rate, five years into the future. About Leidos - Leidos is a Fortune 500® information technology, engineering, and science solutions and services leader working to solve the world’s toughest challenges in the defense, intelligence, homeland security, civil, and health markets.

Submitted by: University of Penn.","Facilitating Linkages Between State and Local IDS and Key Federal Data Sets:State and local governments are increasingly utilizing Integrated Data Systems (IDS) that link administrative data across domains to evaluate federal policies and programs. Often, such efforts are unable to account for individuals who cross state lines or, for other reasons, are not captured in local data sets, and therefore would benefit from a streamlined process for linking existing IDS data with key federal data sets. For example, in order to evaluate federal welfare and workforce development programs, states may seek to understand the earnings trajectories of residents working outside of their state, or those who work for the federal government or military, who will not be captured in state administrative data sources. A process that would allow researchers to send local data for linkage with federal wage records and then analyze the results through a Federal Statistical Research Data Center (RDC) or equivalent would open up the possibilities for many more important uses of state administrative data. ""If many states form a Multi-state Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Research Collaborative in partnership with the Family Self-Sufficiency Data Center to share and securely link data, then there would be comparable analyses on whether: working recipients earn sufficient income to close cases, households that earn their way off benefits main self-sufficiency or do the cases reopen, and workers in households closed due to earnings maintain a stable income after case closings to inform and improve program administration.

The analysis will describe the interaction between work participation and receipt of benefits by addressing questions such as: What working recipients earn sufficient income to close cases? Do households that earn their way off benefits main self-sufficiency, or do the cases reopen? Do the workers in households closed due to earnings maintain a stable income after case closings? Participating agencies receive extensive technical assistance, including assistance with data preparation, data sharing, and/or data analysis, and the opportunity to collaborate and develop a common understanding of best practices together with other partner agencies. We will clearly and transparently document how these analyses are performed (including providing code and detailed definitions) so that other agencies can duplicate these metrics on their own data.

Building on inter-agency efforts like the College Scorecard, as well as public-private collaborations like LEHD's partnership with the University of Texas system, there is a significant opportunity to scale up the voluntary provision of programmatic and credential information from states and individual education and training providers to connect individual participant records with long-term labor market outcomes and make metrics around return on investment in education more broadly available. Several foundations and funders are actively working in creating data standards for program, credential, and competency information and make it easier for education and training institutions to be able to share this data as part of data collaboratives and those efforts could dramatically reduce the costs to federal agencies for receiving and connecting individual and programmatic data, while broadening the set of programs and providers connecting their data. Stakeholders could include NASWA, IMS Global, AACRAO, Dxterra, the Lumina Foundation, Gates Foundation, and others.- Enabling the Availability of Consumer Information on Employers as Engines of Economic Mobility. Building off of the partnership between IRS and Census in allowing new uses of tax records to create public-use datasets through CARRA, several members of the US Chamber of Commerce have expressed a strong interest in measuring their ability as employers to act as engines of economic mobility by voluntarily creation a public-private data collaborative with Census and providing hiring data for cohorts of new hires to connect with long-term labor market outcomes and earnings profiles and provide aggregates statistics on wage trajectories by SOC within employers or employer groups.

Submitted by: J-PAL North America.","Understanding Effects of NeighborhoodsResearchers leading the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment used administrative data to comprehensively examine the long-term impacts of housing voucher programs and moves to lower-poverty neighborhoods.  Through MTO, families were selected by lottery to receive housing vouchers, some of which required families to move to neighborhoods with low poverty rates. Initial and mid-term studies, which leveraged unemployment insurance data, arrest records, college enrollment data, benefits data, and census data found that adults who moved had no change in employment, income, or use of government benefits (although surveys showed they were happier and healthier). However, a long-term follow-up study, made possible by access to tax records, revealed that for young children (less than 13-years-old at the time of the move), moving to a low-poverty neighborhood increased expected lifetime earnings by about $300,000. This study also found that children who moved were more likely to attend college, attended better colleges, and lived in better neighborhoods as adults, and women were less likely to become single mothers. Administrative data allowed for long-term follow-up and was critical in assuring equivalent data coverage for both treatment and control groups, a formidable and expensive task with long-term surveys. For instance, recipients of vouchers may be more likely to have moved and thus harder to locate, or they may be more or less likely to be in jail, employed, etc. These concerns of differential coverage across treatment and control group can be mitigated using administrative data.""When South Carolina replaced their quasi-random, “round robin” procedure, to a explicitly random procedure for Medicaid beneficiaries, then researchers were able to analyze the effect of different managed care plans by matching records of beneficiaries’ plan assignments to various sources of administrative data, including data from Medicaid claims, the Department of Mental Health, the Department of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services, and vital records for “cream skimming” effects—i.e., whether differences in health outcomes across MCOs is the result of different features of the MCOs.

Submitted by: National Minority Technology CouncilLooking Forward Research & Development.","Algorithms that link calculated datasets as predictive exchanges will soon prove the value of smart contracts, governed workflow and merit-based entitlement payout systems focused on outcomes rather than outputs. In order to frame the possibility of a new roadmap to wealth and prosperity for every American we need a baseline that can keep up with iterative change and industry input.The Integrated Economic Indictor State Longitudinal Data System (IEI-SLDS) Use Case frames a new methodology that leverages data to support the mission of preparing Americans for success in a globally competitive world by creating digital outcomes that will be able to predict program success and investment RIO.As a 501(c)6 non-stock trade association we recognize that our members and stakeholders exist in an ecosystem where human capital growth is a function of love, learning and livelihood. Our petition that the U.S. Government consider industry as a valid input towards change and innovation is matched with deep respect with regards to the depth of knowledge born and incubated in our federal research complex.We further ask consideration to the ISI-SLDS Use Case submitted as our Public Comment (attached)Outcome Harmonization – Re-Imagining the American Safety NetOver the past eight years the National Minority Technology Council (NMTC) has investigated the merit of integrating the State Longitudinal Data System (SLDS)1 data sets found in each State with other key economic data in an effort to both create a data scheme to connect State and Local funding to Federal expectations, while focusing on the need for the processing power of federal High-Performance Computing.This Integrated Economic Indicator Use Case utilizing SLDS (ISI-SLDS) affords the contemplation of a national data harmonizing effort to bring together thedisconnected “Social Safety Net” here in America into a transformational predictive system that allows for better policy decision making and innovation, in areas that help put American’s to work.Education and training today are a converging landscape. Over the past three years NMTC has worked with the Virginia Career Education Foundation (VCEF www.vcefworks.org) 2 to develop interoperability methodologies that work towards connecting purpose to mission. Given the recent reform plan and reorganization recommendations provided in the document, “Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century, Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations”3 for the Department of Education and the workforce which articulates the recommendation to merge the Dept. of Education (ED) and Labor (DOL) into a single Cabinet agency, the Department of Education and the Workforce (DEW), the IEI-SLDS Use Case seems timely. The IEI-SLDS Use Case frames a new methodology that leverages data to support the mission of preparing Americans for success in a globally competitive world by creating digital outcomes that will be able to predict program success and investment ROI. Below (Figure 2) is a schema to harmonize the fragmented workforce development programs and processes into a comprehensive workforce data management ecosystem to harmonize and leverage data and data patterns within and across P-20W (early learning through the workforce).Our industry trade association took on the task to communicate and collaborate with P-20W institutions and sectors within the human capital sector to develop public value mapping to conceptualize an approach that could be adopted and improved with federal government stewardship. Above is a framework that was jointly developed through collaboration between the industry subject matter experts associated with NMTC and the State and Local Education and Labor partners located in Virginia associated with VCEF. This high-level framework was envisioned to help education and workforce stakeholders conceptualize that data harmonization will allow for new “dashboards” that will generate new contexts for decision making not currently available.Given the emergency need for a skilled workforce and the disconnect between learning outcomes and industry requirements and the desire for American citizens to enjoy the benefits of work more resources need to be targeted towards training and development. In order to ensure targeted grant funding makes a difference the IEI-SLDS Use Case has a unique opportunity to align top level stakeholders into a room to discuss change. This is by no means a start-up effort as both DOL and ED have, albeit in silos, worked towards solving the workforce challenge utilizing a data-driven approach. DEW allows for a more robust mission that would more directly serve a growth mission. The Common Education Data Standards Initiative (CEDS Initiative)4 “includes a common vocabulary, data models that reflect that vocabulary, tools to help education stakeholders understand and use education data, an assembly of metadata from other education data initiatives, and a community of education stakeholders who discuss the uses of CEDS and the development of the standard”. Stakeholder engagement is critical on many levels; form follows function. This industry recommendation is asking the U.S. Department of Commerce, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs to establish a federal working group to include DOL, DE, DOC, HHS, USDA, HUD, DHS and OPM to improve their ability to understand how programs aimed to reduce poverty can be in part transformed into programs that lift citizens from poverty to high skilled jobs and entrepreneurial activities like cyber security.Data is indeed a strategic asset and it must be leveraged to grow our economy. NMTC further recommends adding state, local, industry and NGO partners to the working group at the beginning. This Administration’s appetite for Public/Private partnership is encouraging and we believe this ISI-SLDS Use Case will build confidence from the citizenry that their vices are being heard that government needs to reform in a way that promotes growth and reduces the silos in the federal government that can be attributed to the systemic moral hazard found in government program implementation and lack of outcome metrics.The ISI-SLDS Use Case will also promote grater commercialization and innovation in the areas of workforce readiness. NMTC believes the investment community feels locked out of the education community. Models like “Pay for Success” require both qualitative and quantitative outcome measurements. Currently the “graduate and done” system of check and balance does not monitor the longitudinal nature of learning in the 21st Century Knowledge Economy. Initiating ISI-SLDS will spawn additional research activities in Artificial Intelligence, Performance Modeling, and Outcome Research geared to measure the nexus between education relevance and economic growth.At the core the U.S. is a global source of hope and wonder. We as a nation have solved problems in a manner that has changed the standard of living for those who enjoy the right to live in this great country. Now more than ever we need not fear the size of the climb born from the idea that we can frame a new way of measuring learning success through the measurement of economic trends gathered at the individual level. In fact now is the time to utilize the full capacity and intellect of our nation to support the idea that every American has the right to learn and be prosperous. As our economy continues to boom our need for improved human capacity will rise. It is our hope as an industry codified to support the minority technology industry that our federal government will take this baton we have carried and support our idea that to build our Republic we must have all hands-on deck.Thank you for the opportunity to bring voice to innovation. The National Minority Technology Council (NMTC) is actively serving our nation by engaging in strategic design based research while acting as a steward to the over 65,000 U.S. owned minority technology companies with combined annual sales of over $100 Billion. This fast growing U.S. based industry sector employs over 500,000 people both here in America and around the world. NMTC is organized as a 501c6 Virginia non-stock industry trade association. NMTC recognizes that building consensus around outcomes requires an integrated approach. Given our industry perspective that our workforce system is not keeping pace with demand and in our more disenfranchised communities this is a national crisis that is in proportion to an issue to our national security as it pertains to our economy. As we move further into the 21st Century we must embrace our national capacity for self-determination, prosperity, and global resilience. As you consider the validity of our need as a nation to better align our data assets with outcomes born from public dollars we as industry will continue to innovate and bring the natural resource of human intellect. Our team of Sr. Fellows, the existence of the many minority technology companies and the will of government, education and the non-profit and philanthropic communities will bring governance to status quo and results to our efforts to create wealth to our nation and our citizenry.REFERENCES1 Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems Grant Program (SLDS)https://nces.ed.gov/programs/slds/2 Virginia Career Education Foundation (VCEF)http://www.vcefworks.org3 Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Centuryhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4548493-Delivering-GovernmentSolutions-in-the-21st.html4 Common Education Data Standards Initiativehttps://ceds.ed.gov/whatIsCEDS.aspx5 Fueling High-Tech Growth through Minority Businesshttps://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2015/08/fueling-high-tech-growth-throughminority-businesses""If the Department of Commerce and other data-holding agencies reduced the burden of redundant security and other controls on researchers, meaningful research could be conducted on linked data. Submitted by: American College of Cardiology.","Social Security Death Master FileClinical data registries such as NCDR often have difficulty obtaining access to mortality information on patients who have undergone procedures. Obtaining information pertaining to patient death, along with other outcomes, is critical to understanding those outcomes, assessing the quality of care patients receive, identifying appropriate patient selection criteria, improving clinician education and more. The Social Security Death Master File (DMF) would provide this information when combined with data maintained by the College through NCDR. Specifically, the ACC views the DMF as a unique source because it contains vital status information on the US population, regardless of how healthcare is paid for, and is provided on a more frequent basis than any other data sources containing this type of information, providing more timely, and thus, more meaningful feedback on patient outcomes.Unfortunately, because of statutory and regulatory changes, the College is unable to access the DMF directly at this time, despite being able to access other sensitive sources of data maintained by the government.Under 42 USC § 405(r)(9), the College believes that HHS has the authority to match Medicare claims data with death data contained in the SSDMF file and to provide the linked dataset to clinical data registries for use in improving care quality, thus providing clinical data registries with this vital information. Unfortunately, despite clear interest by CMS to incorporate clinical data registries into patient care for the purpose of improving outcomes, HHS has declined to provide this access. The ACC believes it is in the public interest to provide organizations, such as the College, access to this information and urges the DOC to encourage HHS to do so, as well as to ensure that such situations are addressed under the Federal Data Strategy. Granting this access will improve accuracy, which will augment the ability of clinical data registries to provide clinicians with accurate information on improving the quality of care patients receive.Individualized security programs DOC is not the first federal government department or agency to address the question of how to ensure appropriate public access to sensitive government-maintained. CMS collects a significant amount of data that it makes available to researchers through a defined process. While it does not have a formal certification process, what it requires of researchers is analogous to the process created by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) for access to the DMF. Specifically, CMS requires that researchers and those seeking access to its data enter into a Data Use Agreement (DUA)1 with the Agency. This DUA requires applicants to provide a detailed study protocol that specifies information regarding the requestor’s rationale for obtaining the data, security procedures, operational information, financial commitment and more. All individuals who have access to the data must complete and file a DUA with CMS. Additionally, there are detailed procedures that must be followed upon study completion pertaining to destruction of the data.The burdens associated with current government processes for accessing clinical data are significant. In particular, the level of burden associated with compiling CMS and CDC data requests is sizable. Simply demonstrating that all of the requirements have been met takes a significant investment of time and resources, between the development of the study protocol, completing the required forms and describing security protocols, not to mention making any required changes to current organizational protocols. Additionally, tracking all of the individual DUAs is administratively burdensome. While CMS does not officially “certify” organizations for access to its data, it will not allow access until organizations demonstrate compliance with its procedures. The same holds true for CDC. Rather than forcing organizations to comply with multiple sets of security requirements, the administrative burden will be reduced significantly for researchers if they can turn to one set of requirements. As such, the ACC recommends that DOC create standard programs for providing the public with access to sensitive data sets based on the requisite data security requirements, deeming individuals or organizations that have met those requirements as certified for access to requested datasets. Medical researchers often must contend with multiple mechanisms for ensuring data privacy and security. Because the ACC maintains individually identifiable personal health information (PHI), the College is required to comply with all of the privacy and security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Additionally, the ACC has obtained data for research from CMS and must comply with the terms of its DUA. The College would be happy to furnish DOC with information regarding its privacy and security protocols to assist in the development of the DMF certification process, as we have done as part of a DUA with CMS. However, to do so in a public forum could potentially jeopardize the privacy and security of data maintained by the College. As such, we would welcome the opportunity to follow up with DOC directly to explain the various measures that are employed by the College to ensure data privacy and security.Redundant and burdensome fee structuresAdditionally, the cost for obtaining both the CDC NDI files and the CMS data can be quite expensive.Both require payment on a per-record basis with additional flat fees required to be paid by all requestors, regardless of the number of records requested. This does not factor in the costs associated with the resources required to apply for the data. Such high costs reduce the ability of researchers without significant resources to access the data for research and other legitimate purposes. The College urges the DOC to consider the government’s fee structure associated with access to such datasets and to impose only such fees as are necessary to pay for the resources needed for the creation and maintenance of the certification process.Currently, access to certain files used for medical research, such as those of CMS and CDC, is controlled based on specific study protocols. In these instances, separate requests are required based on the intended use of the data, along with separate fees and repetitious demonstrations that the College’s protocols meet the security requirements. Additionally, access is limited to the specific data sets required to conduct the specific study. This imposes unnecessary and potentially cost-prohibitive burdens upon researchers, particularly those interested in using the data to improve patient care and outcomes. The ACC urges the DOC to address these redundancies and limit the related burdens as it develops the Federal Data Strategy""If the Department of Commerce exercised its discretionary authority to share data with outside parties, citizens would be empowered to assess the quality of services they access. Submitted by: American College of Cardiology.","Medicare claims data Quality measurement is key to improving patient care. Matching the high quality clinical data from NCDR with claims data from CMS would permit the College to model/calculate risk-adjusted outcomes measures such as 30-day complication rates, 30-day readmission rates and potentially others for Medicare patients with the ultimate intention of including these measures in our voluntary public reporting program, a program that began in September 2015 and grew to include more than 200 hospitals within the first six months. However, current regulations restrict access to the Medicare claims dataset to select groups that meet the requirements of the qualified entity (QE) program. Under the QE program, groups seeking access to the Medicare claims dataset must combine the dataset with another claims dataset. Recent statutory changes permit qualified clinical data registries (QCDR) to access the Medicare claims dataset without the second claims dataset. To improve existing metrics and to develop additional ones, the College applied to become a QE under the existing program and was rejected because it did not propose to combine the Medicare data with another claims dataset. Of ACC’s ten registries, only two meet the requirements to be QCDRs, meaning that the College, despite its widely acknowledged commitment to quality measurement and service as a trusted source of information pertaining to quality patient care, has limited ability to access the Medicare claims dataset to develop quality measures. It is clear from the recent statutory changes, as well as recent regulations pertaining to access to Medicare claims data that CMS intends for medical specialty societies to obtain access to the Medicare claims dataset and for the aforementioned organizations to use this data for the purpose of developing clinical quality measures. However, all will face the challenge of identifying an additional reliable and valid nationwide claims dataset with which to combine the Medicare claims data. Based on the College’s extensive research into this problem, there are some reliable local and regional claims datasets available for purchase, but no reliable national database of private payer claims with which to combine the Medicare data. While incomplete datasets are useful for a variety of purposes, including signal development and research, quality measure development and reporting are not among them. Those gaps in the datasets would produce unreliable and invalid metrics that could tarnish the reputations of high quality hospitals and clinicians, harming patients in the long run. Providing the ACC and other medical specialty societies with access to the Medicare dataset would allow such groups to match the dataset with high quality, validated clinical data collected in clinical data registries, such as the NCDR, to develop quality metrics that would provide patients with information regarding the quality of care they can expect to see from hospitals and clinicians. The College believes that the public benefit of this effort is greater than any reservations CMS has regarding reliability and validity of metrics developed only with one source of claims data. Additionally, the ACC believes that combining the claims data with NCDR’s clinical data will offset any other concerns that CMS has with respect to the use of only one claims dataset in future analysis of the linked datasets. The College urges the DOC to examine, as part of the Federal Data Strategy, any potential statutory hurdles to furnishing access to parties that Congress clearly intended to include. Additionally, the ACC urges DOC to work with relevant agencies to encourage the exercise of discretionary authority granted to them to provide access to the data to as many individuals or organizations as possible. ""If the Census Bureau adopted new data sources and collection techniques, it could reduce respondent burden in increase sample representation while maintaining confidentiality and privacy.

The dashboard also graphically displays trends over time and developments with defense trade partners that could not have been detected by our traditional PDF depictions of Excel spreadsheet information.  As a result, PM is able to respond faster (within minutes, not days) to requests for defense trade information by utilizing new filtering and data visualization techniques, both for internal customers within State as well as in “data” diplomacy efforts abroad.  ""The Administration should leverage existing standards efforts, such as GAAP, DAIMS, and NIEM. Submitted by: Data Coalition.","As the Administration makes plans to improve management practices we hope leadership will consider leveraging existing standards efforts, such as the US GAAP Taxonomy, the DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS), and the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM), which have each begun the important work of using government data to drive oversight, reform, and accountability.""If the Administration works with the SEC and the FASB to assure that the US GAAP Taxonomy is the true taxonomy element reference and minimize the creation of extension data elements, the SEC and external parties will benefit from the resulting improvement in data quality. Submitted by: Data Coalition.","USE CASE #1: FIX PUBLIC COMPANY FILINGS (ACCESS, USE, AND AUGMENTATION) Since 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been requiring public companies to report their financial statements in a standardized, non-proprietary machine-readable format called eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL). Maintaining the standard is the independent Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which has developed and continually worked to update a taxonomy, or list of data tags, reflecting the accounting concepts of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP). (For details, see: https://www.fasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=Page&cid=1176169699514&d=&pagename=FASB%2FPage% 2FSectionPage) (see also: https://www.workiva.com/blog/your-guide-2018-us-gaap-taxonomy-update).However, the implementation of this taxonomy has not fully delivered the promised benefits of comparability, transparency, and market efficiency. First, the US GAAP Taxonomy is too complicated to allow easy comparability and has thousands more electronic tags than are needed to accurately reflect corporate financial statements. Second, the SEC permits companies to create custom-built extension tags in far too many circumstances. The major information data aggregators, such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, and Morningstar, still do not ingest the SEC's XBRL corporate financial data without significant edits. Smaller, creative intermediaries are making progress, but the reality is that the U.S. capital markets do not efficiently absorb XBRL data. As a result, U.S. public companies are not experiencing lower costs of capital from filing XBRL reports. Until the SEC fixes the US GAAP Taxonomy and addresses the overuse of extensions, its XBRL open-data reporting regime for financial statements will not deliver the promised benefits.The Data Foundation’s “Open Data for Financial Reporting: Costs, Benefits, and Future” (see: http://www.datafoundation.org/xbrl-report-2017) provides the history of the US GAAP Taxonomy, outlines the benefits to the SEC’s disclosure modernization reform efforts, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.A recent report by member company Donnelley Financial Solutions, “A New Approach to Data Quality: How the SEC Can Prepare for a RegTech, SupTech and AI Future” (see: https://www.datacoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DFS-Summary-June27Final.pdf), outlines additional steps to address taxonomy improvements, while also outlining the future benefits to the regulators, including the applications of emerging tech for supervisory technology workflow (i.e., SupTech; the technology regulators use internally to conduct their enforcement, supervisory, and research activities).ACTION:The Administration should work with the SEC and the FASB to assure that the US GAAP Taxonomy:First, enforces FASB codifications as the true reference for all elements in the taxonomy, thereby eliminating unnecessary tags, reducing the complexity of the taxonomy. For example, incorrect references should be replaced with missing references. The filer is in the better position to know the relevant codifications that shape their filing, and can help make self-tagged data more accurate than service-provider tagged data. Additionally, accessing elements through the codifications will make it easier to find the standard elements to use, thereby eliminating unnecessary extension elements. The SEC should make sure filers follow the recommendations of the FASB’s Efficiency and Effectiveness preparers report.Second, minimizes the creation of extension data elements, thereby improving comparability and data quality.INTERNAL BENEFITS:By reforming the US GAAP Taxonomy, the SEC will gain the benefits of ingesting more accurate and comparable corporate information to conduct anti-fraud investigations and identify systemic market risk.EXTERNAL BENEFITS:Investors and data aggregators will benefit from more comparable market information. Filers will benefit from a taxonomy that more closely mirrors the requirements of US GAAP and their internal accounting and audit practices.""If the Administration endorses the Legal Entity Identifier as the default, agencies and external parties will benefit from increased ability to match data. Submitted by: Data Coalition.","The federal government currently uses a wide variety (see: https://www.datacoalition.org/a-jungle-of- entity-identifiers-and-what-were-going-to-do-about-it/%5C) of codes to identify companies, nonprofits, and other non-federal entities. Because the same entity is identified differently with each agency it reports to, entity matching is a time-consuming and expensive threshold challenge for nearly every federal data analytics project.In 2010, to address the expense and opacity of incompatible entity identification systems, the U.S. Treasury Department and foreign financial regulators started a global nonprofit organization to create and maintain the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) (see: https://www.financialresearch.gov/from-the- director/2017/02/02/breaking-through-barriers-impeding-financial-data-standards/), a versatile and non-proprietary code that can be adopted within any regulatory regime. Several federal agencies are now considering adopting the LEI alongside existing non-interoperable identification codes.ACTION:The Administration should establish a policy statement endorsing the LEI as the default identification code for legal entities. The White House OMB Office of the CIO should direct all agencies to report on the disparate identification codes they currently use and the feasibility of a full transition to the LEI. The federal government should adopt an open and common universal identification code to be integrated into agency systems. These actions should be directed by a universal entity identification working groupINTERNAL BENEFITS:The establishment of a universal entity identification working group will speed up current federal agency initiatives seeking to standardize entity identification and encourage the formation of new ones.Ultimately, the adoption of a universal, non-proprietary entity identifier will enable agencies to aggregate, compare, and match data sets critical to their regulatory or programmatic missions.EXTERNAL BENEFITS:This will facilitate, where appropriate, the publication of bulk data sets which would otherwise be inhibited by the proprietary nature of currently-used entity identification systems.""If the Administration utilizes DAIMS for modernizing budget formulation and agency financial reporting, both agencies and Congress will be more empowered to make data-driven decisions. Submitted by: Data Coalition.","The U.S. Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget have spent over four years working with agencies and outside stakeholders to establish and integrate the DAIMS into agency systems. With over 400 unique data elements the DAIMS represents the most comprehensive and widely adopted data standard for federal operations in the U.S. government. The DAIMS links budget, accounting, procurement, and financial assistance datasets that were previously segmented across agency systems and databases. OMB should rely on the DAIMS’s open documentation architecture which allows for ready expansion and linkage to other administrative datasets. Furthermore, in his Senate confirmation hearings OMB Director Mick Mulvaney suggested that future budget requests could be published in a machine-readable and DATA Act compatible format.ACTION:The Administration should utilize the DAIMS for modernizing the annual budget process, agency financial reporting, and agency performance reporting:Annual Proposed Budget - The Administration should centrally publish the Administration's annual budget request including the corresponding standardized agency Congressional Justifications (CJs) in a bulk downloadable, machine-readable, and DAIMS-compatible format.Congressionally Approved Budget - The Administration should publish the Congressionally produced federal budget in a manner that integrates with the DAIMS to enable comparisons with current agency finances.Agency Financial and Performance Reporting - Machine-readable data, in a common schema (e.g.,integrated with the DAIMS), should be part of OMB’s Annual Performance and Annual Financial Report which agencies are required to submit. Data-driven reporting provides an opportunity to improve efficiency while creating a more sustainable, meaningful, and repeatable process. Creating the critical connection between finance and performance information in a compelling, engaging, and informative way provides the opportunity for agencies, constituents, OMB, Congress, and others to derive greater value and insight from these reports. OMB would need to replace the document-based reporting methods with a consistent data schema that enables data-centric agency budget and financial reporting. OMB and agencies should also tie their goals to broader program areas.INTERNAL BENEFITS:Annual Proposed Budget - Will enable the Administration to easily use data to compare and justify the proposed budget in support of strategic goals.Congressionally Approved Budget - Will help agencies monitor current spending against the enacted budget, thus enabling visibility into funding distribution and timely planning.Agency Financial and Performance Reporting - Will help agencies adopt efficient data-driven strategies, diminish duplication of efforts, increase intra- & inter-agency information sharing, and reduce the resources required for information collection.EXTERNAL BENEFITS:Annual Proposed Budget - Will enable Congress and the public to more efficiently ingest linked data compromising the annual federal budget, parse proposed changes to programs, quickly compare budget plans against current fiscal year spending activity, and perform external budgetary analysis utilizing accurate data linkages. Will enrich the national conversation around the government’s budget by assuring more accurate interpretations and enable more informed discussions about the performance of particular government programs. Congressionally Approved Budget - Will help users more efficiently interpret the enacted budget in the context of specific agency program funding and award opportunities that matter to their own organizations.Agency Financial and Performance Reporting - Benefits include transparency and accountability from publishing public sector data which fosters innovation across the academic, research, and technical developer community. By putting digitally integrated performance and budget information in the hands of the public, agencies will have the opportunity to articulate what’s working and what’s not, and develop necessary buy-in for improvement plans.""If the government built a platform supporting access to multiple data sources and user groups, agencies would benefit. Submitted by: IBM Global Business Services .","1.3 Implement Supporting Platform(s)The Federal government should consider a platform (or platforms) that facilitates the use of multiple sources of data by multiple user groups. The platform should be flexible for future expansions in number and types of data, users, and use scenarios. Federal agencies would benefit from data architecture large enough to hold vast quantities of data, especially as we move to more real-time data collection through smart devices and sensors. The infrastructure needs to be accessible to a large number of users and robust enough to provide open access to multiple users at one time if they simultaneously try to access the same data. Such is the case with NOAA weather data that many users access concurrently when incorporating real-time weather data into their severe weather warnings. Finally, the infrastructure needs to be large and accessible to ensure sufficient storage capacity in order to archive the data.The following items support this task:Architecture – Assess current and future architecture states, explore data demand profile, and provide roadmap and recommendation to address the architecture strategy.Archive and Streamline Applications – Consolidate applications, retire outdated databases, and modernize existing systems to focus on important projects, thus reducing risk and enhancing application quality.""When analytics are applied to data, they can be transformed into tangible business value.

Submitted by: IBM Global Business Services .","2.1 Enterprise Data GovernanceTo implement Enterprise Data Governance the Federal government should select a robust, proven Data Governance Framework that is informed by a Data Strategy that aligns with the Government vision to leverage data as a strategic asset. IBM recommends developing an Information Governance Operating model adapting the concepts shown in the Figure below to work in the Federal government; for example, by emphasizing better decision making, more use of government data by industry, etc. A Data Governance Leadership Counsel would lead, execute, and enforce the model working with all other organizations. NIST could take a leadership role in formulating the Data Governance Framework similar to its role in the development of the successful framework for Cybersecurity. The data governance program components are enabled and enhanced by the use of technology. The rigorous implementation of this operating model will help to define roles for data stewardship, establish a data governance framework to consolidate and streamline data, de- conflict data, and develop consistent data policies so that the data management system can achieve meaningful use from disparate data sources across the Federal ecosystem.""If the government creates a platform using education and job data, job-seekers and employers will benefit along with the economy. Submitted by: IBM Global Business Services .","4.1 Use Case 1A COGNITIVE JOB MATCHING PLATFORM EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICAN WORKERSPROBLEM: American workers struggle to find jobs that match their skills, experience, interests, location and other needs. And while apprenticeship, vocational training, and other similar talent development and training program resources and opportunities are available, information about them is disjointed and inefficiently disseminated. Access is managed in a stove-piped, parochial manner instead of one aimed at the job seeker, resulting in an information-sharing environment that is sub-optimized, wasteful and ineffective in achieving its main objective: to match a willing, able and skilled workforce with gainful employment opportunities.OBJECTIVE: Create a Federal user-centric, intuitive and modern platform integrating job vacancy, apprenticeship, vocational training, and other relevant skill and talent development programs to match opportunities with individual users based on their submitted profiles and needs (job history, education, skills, experience, location, career path interest, etc.). The new platform will combine the latest capabilities, solutions, and technologies implemented in the private sector with federal, state and local, trade, and non-profit resources and programs to build a cognitive job matching platform that significantly improves and accelerates access to information and optimizes resource allocation and impact. SOLUTION• Deploy a new platform to connect job/apprenticeship seekers with the most suitable opportunities, resources and information by:• Collecting, integrating and organizing published vacancy, apprenticeship, training, and other relevant information from federal, state, local, trade, and non- profit agencies and organizations using data integration and data virtualization micro-services into a federated data store that is aligned with data governance• Building out a robust user profile capability which is integrated with existing job portals/aggregators (including but not limited to USAJOBS.gov, monster.com, careerbuilder.com and others) and provides intuitive, cognitive assistance with career path and skill development tracks• Using cognitive data science models and Machine Learning techniques to access information, identify patterns and relationships across structured (metadata) and unstructured data (documents, etc.) and present tailored results to each individual user• Using Natural Language processing and Sentiment Analysis to provide enhanced conversation capabilities to users through a Cognitive Advisor, thus enabling enhanced search and self-service capabilities• Enabling job/apprenticeship seekers, recruiters and hiring professionals, and educators and training program professionals to connect virtually via a collaborative web platform and provide tailored advice and assistance to users• Setting up an enterprise-level Web and mobile platform that will drive collaboration and invoke conversation services to enhance customer interaction and satisfaction through multiple channels (consider opening other channels, such as a “311”-type hot line, for job seekers without internet or mobile access)• Enhance platform with a digital career advisor to help guide job seekers to hot skills in high demand. This advisor provides job seekers with opportunities to understand how to transform their skills individually through learning and targeted career changes and in doing so, help them achieve ongoing employability• Extend digital platform services to offer online and in-person training and boot camps. Learning and re-training is a strategic competitive advantage in industry and government alike. A digital learning experience platform provides distributed learning capability anytime and anywhere, through desktop or laptop and fully enabled mobile devices. Boot camps for candidate selection and employee re-tooling can be delivered by way of certifying entities. The focus of these activities is on technical skills that have been identified to be in demand in the new digital economy• Incorporate certification and/or credentialing of STEM and other critically needed skills. By certification, organizations can identify visible skill gaps and recognize skill impediments to achieving certifications. Digital credentials create a registry of verified skills that employers and the market value most. Developing career paths supported by defined certifications and digital credentials will educate job seekers about their skill gaps and incentivize them to progress toward their attainment. Prospective employers will gain insight into the upcoming “pipeline” of qualified or near-qualified candidates• Creating public/private partnerships between industry and government will open the door to innovation and cost savings on a scale currently unattainable. This model will accelerate adoption of industry best-in-class practices and solutions and maximize existing resources at lower cost and risk for the government. It will also provide accurate insight into talent supply and demand to help drive appropriate policy-making and inform hiring organizations about the current and future availability of talent. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS & NEXT STEPS• Start small and quickly expand on early successes – focus on advanced manufacturing and IT jobs and apprenticeship programs as a proof of concept and quickly expand into other high impact areas• Enable mobile capability in the design of the solution allowing all seekers to access the resource anytime, anywhere• Foster public-private partnership and leverage best-in-class commercial practices, existing government (federal, state, local and tribal) programs and resources, and non- profit, trade, and education research and experience• Assess the viability/suitability of, and consider leveraging existing digital assets to accelerate platform development and adoption• Focus not only on intuitive UI and user-centric design but also on setting up a powerful analytics/cognitive engine to derive maximum value from structured and unstructured data• Leverage the new governance and accountability framework established under the new Executive Order on Expanding Apprenticeships to ensure stakeholder participation, collaboration, and buy-in.""If the government invests in an intelligent assistant to ingest unstructured data and analyze it using modern NLP, the government would be able to capitalize on its wealth of underutilized unstructured data. Submitted by: IBM Global Business Services .","4.2 Use Case 2AN INTELLIGENT ASSISTANT FOR STANDARDIZING, ANALYZING AND CONTINUALLY IMPROVING DATAPROBLEM: Government agencies have an abundance of valuable data, but much of that data is stored in non-standard formats, largely because the data is received from third parties, be it other government agencies or commercial sources. This data enters the agency in both structured and unstructured formats but is largely not processed or standardized for use.Unstructured data, which accounts for 80% of the world's data, is underused because traditional approaches to harvesting and standardizing are expensive and have not dealt well with variable formats. Without standardization of both structured and unstructured data, agencies, especially those with limited resources miss out on developing data as a strategic asset, failing to capitalize on an opportunity that can reinvent the way government delivers mission outcomes.OBJECTIVE: Create a cost effective Intelligent Assistant (Robotic Process Automation technology integrated with AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning) that processes, standardizes, analyzes and acts on structured and unstructured data. The Intelligent Assistant will be trained to read and standardize both structured and unstructured data into a common format for use, and load into a database, distributed database, distributed ledger, block chain, or other format for use. The innovation of the Intelligent Assistant is a cost-effective data harvesting and structuring solution that extends the capabilities of its human counterparts to capture and standardize entities from a number of sources. Unlike traditional ETL and NLP solutions that require a great deal of programming and expense, Intelligent Assistants are more user friendly, quickly programmed, and able to work flexibly with business users in environments responding to change in data capture and standardization task. Oftentimes these assistants are a great compliment to larger scale IT standardization efforts that are not as flexible in dealing with more dynamic source structures and lower volume. Beyond harvesting and standardizing data, Intelligent Assistants are able to perform operations on the standardize data set they built, other operations include, data cleansing, quality analysis, and deep analysis on structured data sets that can lead to valuable insights that improve mission outcomes.SOLUTION• Use Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to automate the standardization of structured data in disparate formats into a common format. Static data that is collected from various sources can be defined by different parameters (order of characters, number of characters, etc.) – automations can be programmed using OCR to read, sort, and structure data into a common format that makes data useable.• Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to harvest entities of unstructured data into a common format in support of various use cases. Additionally, NLP can be used to capture and organize additional context of data that can be used integrated with other data sets to provide powerful insights that may have otherwise been missed.• Establish a database to store and manage standardized data. One option is a standard database, which allows agencies to visualize the data that is available and analyze to figure out how to leverage that data to improve mission delivery. Another option is a distributed ledger, the Blockchain, which provides a constant, immutable method of storing and tracking data to make sure standardized data remains in that format and its path through analysis and output is managed within a business network.• Determine what value can be extracted from existing data and automate analysis to continue to gather actionable insights as data is changed, added and subtracted throughout the data lifecycle.• Automate the continual standardization and analysis of data and create automations that take necessary action on insights drawn from the data.CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS & NEXT STEPS• Find a use case and supporting data set(s). The data set should have a large volume of high value data in order to prove value. It should receive data from multiple sources, structured and unstructured, and should currently be in a form that is not standardized or not accessible. For example, Federal employee data is gathered from each individual agency and stored largely in PDFs by OPM – the automation solution could process PDFs, combine the data in those forms with structured data, and place it in a location that would be accessible and useful to OPM. This type of data issue can affect all agencies, not only in the back office and shared services space, but also in the mission space.• Start small and scale. Intelligent Automation efforts work based when they start with a small, high value use case to prove value. In this case, that may be starting with one type of unstructured data input and automating its processing and standardization into a database. From there, additional data sources would be tackled one by one until the solution encompasses all potential data sources.• Have a strategy for data management. As stated above, the data can be stored in a variety of ways, from a traditional database to the Blockchain. Standardizing without determining the proper storage and usage mechanism will fail to show the value.• Invest in Intelligent Assistants as a Service. The “as a service” model allows the government to buy automation outcomes without the time and costs required to purchase licenses, hosting, and resource training in order to deliver successful automation. IAaaS will allow this effort to succeed at low cost, in a short time frame, and will allow successful efforts to build on each other more quickly and scale.SUGGESTED PILOT USE CASES:• Patent & Trademark Office: This office within the Department of Commerce collects and uses data from various third party sources for patent and trademark application, processing, adjudication and management. Current processes to standardize and use data are expensive and cumbersome. Conduct an Intelligent Automation pilot program to harvest and standardize PTO data that can be used not only to analyze and identify patterns and trends, but also to improve PTO processes such as making routing recommendations for incoming applications, identifying commonalities and redundancies, and ultimately reducing processing time and management efforts.Grants Management: The Department of Commerce currently manages grants in several disparate systems and collects data from thousands of sources. Use the Intelligent Assistant to intake, harvest and standardize data across systems and store and manage that data in a common platform. That data can then be analyzed and acted upon to improve the speed and accuracy of grants processing while reducing overall costs.""If the government created a standard healthcare provider identifier that functioned across agency and domains, payment timing would improve and fraud detection would be more effective. Submitted by: IBM Global Business Services .","4.3 Use Case 3HOW MASTER DATA MANAGEMENT and IDENTITY RESOLUTION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER ‘IDENTIFIERS’ WOULD IMPROVE PROGRAM INTEGRITY AND REDUCE FRAUD, WASTE, ABUSE AND ERROR IN HEALTH CARE CLAIMS AND PRESCRIPTION PAYMENTSPROBLEM: Health care is one of the largest expenditures for the US Federal Government. Despite new approaches and programs to reel in health care costs and reverse fraud, waste and abuse (FWA), the need for healthcare services is growing. Compounding this challenge is the aging population and new Military and Veteran Health services which are now comingled with commercial health and add even greater costs. The ‘Opioid Epidemic’ has increased the need to determine identities and relationships with patients, other prescribers and pharmacies. More than 10 separate federal agencies (CMS – Medicare/Medicaid, SSA, VA, DHA, HHS, IHS, etc.), 50 states and 9 territories pay claims or reimbursements for health care services and prescriptions for over 140,000,000 Americans. In addition, each agency has its own processes and procedures to achieve program integrity and prevent fraud, waste and abuse and erroneous payments of these claims. There is NO single identifier for these Healthcare providers (i.e. SSN) which is capable of identifying the provider across the health care continuum.Short of a single consolidated shared services Center for Healthcare Claims Processing, there IS one entity that is a critical key to bring the agencies together for virtual shared services, claims and payments: The Provider (aka Practitioner, Prescriber, Facilitator).Depending on the agency, the “Provider” is known by many ‘identifiers’: CMS has the National Provider Index (NPI – a 10-digit randomly generated, intelligence-free unique identifier). Other agencies have their own way to identify a provider (State license numbers, DEA registration numbers, SSN, or others) allowing for error or intentional submission of claims for payment under other provider identifiers (name, address, etc.)OBJECTIVE: Create a virtual Federal healthcare provider/practitioner/prescriber “golden identifier” (in lieu of a National Provider Identifier) to ensure identity matched to a healthcare service provider to be used for all claims and reimbursements for payment, regardless of agency or commercial entity providing the payment for service. The new solution will combine the latest capabilities, solutions and technologies implemented in the public and private sectors that significantly improves accuracy and timeliness of payments and greatly reduces fraud, waste and abuse of bad actors, errors and omissions as they exist throughout the industry.SOLUTION• Deploy a proven Master Data Management and identity proofing resolution solution to produce a single ‘golden identifier’ of all healthcare providers, practitioners, prescribers and facilitators across all federally funded claims paying systems regardless of agency or existing identifier (i.e. NPI, SSN, State License, etc.)o Healthcare organizations that are looking for ways to enhance the quality and efficiency of care by increasing the meaningful use of patient and provider information residing in their health systems.o Building out a robust provider profile record integrating federal and state licensures and existing identifiers to ensure a complete view of each individual provider.o Determine linkages and disconnections of providers as prescribers across localities, relationships, pharmacies, identities/patients in priority on opioid use, abuse and prevention of death. Coordinate and collaborate with DEA and other Opioid Task Force programs.o Allow for existing agency program integrity and FWA solutions to accelerate from Pay-and- Chase to Prepayment reviews, thereby preventing improper payments being made.o Provides a better tool for Agency Inspector Generals to identify and pursue individuals who have committed acts and received payments for services not rendered or scamming the system.o Using Natural Language processing powered by predictive analytic markup language functions an artificial intelligence to provide enhanced capabilities to agencies, enabling enhanced search and self-service capabilities• Link with the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) to ensure timely and accurate information on sanctions, malpractice, adverse impact. (This NPDB is a static repository and needs to be highly accurate and current as practitioners are delivering healthcare services via multiple agencies’ funding). Allow and engage state health agency reporting.• Create public/private partnerships between commercial insurers, pharmaceutical companies, industry and governments to open the door to innovation and cost savings on a scale currently unattainable. This model will accelerate cost avoidance and savings through best-in-class practices and solutions without standardizing on a single provider identifier in very short term. No changes will be required to existing identifiers, for minimal disruption of existing resources. It will also provide accurate insight into ALL government payments for healthcare and help drive appropriate policy-making to further reduce fraud, waste and abuse by healthcare service and prescription providers. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS & NEXT STEPS• Start by understanding each agency’s provider ”Identifier” to ensure existing identifier is not a problem in and of itself. Then begin with CMS (existing NPI identifier for all providers of Medicare and Medicaid services) and one additional agency for a proof of concept and quickly expand into other agencies.• Foster public-private partnerships, and leverage best-in-class commercial practices, existing government (federal, state, local and tribal) programs and resources, and non-profit, trade and education research and experience.• Assess the viability/suitability of, and consider leveraging, existing assets to accelerate platform development and replication.Leverage new governance and accountability framework established under the new Executive Orders and Programs: PMA, Reorg and Reform, TMF (Technology Modernization Fund), etc. to ensure stakeholder participation, collaboration, and buy-in.""When Ivy Tech Community College implemented data governance and predictive analytics, it was able to proactively address struggling students to significantly decrease failure rates. Submitted by: Hitachi Vantara Federal.","Ivy Tech Community College, the state community college system in Indiana, is the largest community college in the United States with 175,000 students each year, 120 campuses across the state generating 100 million new records every day. The institution is using predictive analytics to combat a nationwide trend of fewer than 66 percent of Americans who enroll in a four-year college program graduate within six years. Thirty percent of students fail to complete their first year. To address this, Ivy Tech created “NewT” (for the “New Thing”), a system of curated data sets across student records, financial aid, and accounts payable data to eliminate data silos and put actionable data in the hands of educators who could assist at-risk students. To guarantee data quality, Ivy Tech established data governance and data preparation practices and data cleansing shifted away from the warehouse and into production with functional areas continuing to keep their own data sets clean. Basic data reporting was self-serve, with users having the power to drag and drop data elements into and out of existing templates, reports, graphs, and dashboards and share new models between users and departments without IT’s help. The technical team specifically created an innovative predictive data model and identified a data set of 16,247 at-risk students in the first two weeks of a sixteen-week term. Over 800 faculty, staff and administrators then interviewed 5,118 of those students over the next two weeks. The team learned failure was sometimes associated with healthcare, transportation and childcare challenges, and these students were steered toward resources that could help.  By eliminating data silos and using predictive analytics to identify students at risk of failing or dropping out Ivy Tech decreased the number of students with Ds and Fs at midterm by 3.3 percent, or 3,100 students""When NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration developed the Data Integration, Visualization, Exploration, and Reporting application, it empowered researchers and the public to assess disaster-related damage and restoration efforts.

Through the application’s publicly available portal, researchers and interested individuals search terabytes of data and gain insight into the impact of contaminants on the environment. DIVER ingests structured and unstructured scientific data collected by researchers in various forms including field observations, lab analysis results, photographs, geospatial data and instrument outputs. As updated or new information becomes available from each source system, data are automatically audited and pulled into the common repository. The application then blends and standardizes these disparate files and databases together. This new data is then integrated with historical data from legacy systems, which is most of NOAA’s data sets. In DIVER there are records of over 20 years of toxicity data and contaminant chemistry from sediment and tissue samples. DIVER uses this blended data to produce interactive reports made available to the public through the application’s website. On DIVER’s online browser, researchers and the public can query the data and search interactive reports.

Submitted by: NYU School of Medicine .","A proposed surveillance toolTo support effective, forceful yet nimble action to quell the opioid epidemic across the United States, it is essential to harness the rich trove of confidential microdata on the opioid supply and on indicators of opioid-related harm to improve national capacity to reliably track its evolution, predict where and who it will affect next, and identify new and promising interventions.  Timely access is needed to comprehensive and geographically granular data over time on: (1) state- and local-level laws, policies, and services that may impact opioid-related harm; (2) indicators of the shifting legal and illegal drug market; and (3) measures of opioid overdose and associated outcomes. A user-friendly, web-based national Opioid Epidemic Surveillance and Response Dashboard (OESRD) can offer an effective platform for these data. It can store multiple sources of confidential microdata (i.e., hospital discharges, vital statistics, prescription retail sales, drug seizures) securely, and provide a user-friendly platform for government agencies to add confidential data as soon as it becomes available. It can allow immediate lookup of data at the local level, provide for comparisons within and across states and time, and enable local, state and federal policymakers and agencies to target policies and programs to those factors that have the greatest impact on opioid overdose rates. We propose a dashboard that focuses squarely on overdose as a lead indicator of the opioid epidemic, while also supporting efforts to track and combat other dimensions of the epidemic, including opioid misuse and opioid use disorder. Building such a resource would advance the Department of Health and Human Services’ 5 Point Strategy to Combat the Opioids Crisis, by addressing Point 2: Better Data. While disparate efforts have sought to integrate certain data on the opioid epidemic, no single national database resource of requisite depth and scale exists at this time. Proposed objectivesOverall goal1. To create a comprehensive national database of confidential microdata on fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses, national, state and local drivers of and responses to the opioid epidemic, and to describe and analyze trends in opioid overdoses in the United States. Specific objectives1. To compile and link data on: opioid laws and policies; access to opioid use disorder services and medications; the opioid supply; opioid use, overdose, and related outcomes; factors associated with opioid overdose risk; and evidence on what works to prevent and treat opioid misuse, overdose, and opioid use disorders. 2. To create a database that provides a secure, centralized, user-friendly, and up-to-date resource to track patterns of the opioid overdose burden and local and state responses to this problem over time.3. To develop a sustainable, dynamic, public-interfacing queryable website accessible to the public, policymakers and researchers.Proposed audiences and intended applicationsThe primary audience for the OESRD will be local, state, and federal policymakers. At the local and state level, policymakers such as mayors, city managers, governors, and agency leaders can use its timely data to identify trends in prescribing patterns, drug markets and opioid overdoses, identify geographic areas of risk within and across states, develop a strategic plans to address local opioid overdose trends, and track progress towards reaching strategic goals. While several states have already developed such dashboards (see, for example: http://preventoverdoseri.org), each one captures different measures, diminishing the ability to generalize and apply lessons learned across state lines.  At the national level, policymakers and researchers can use this data to track how the opioid epidemic is evolving across states, to identify geographic and socio-demographic groups at highest risk, to test hypotheses about the potential determinants of the epidemic, and to evaluate the effectiveness of current approaches to address this public health crisis. Innovation To date, multiple efforts exist to develop national databases addressing the opioid epidemic. These include, among others: ODMAP, the amfAR Opioid & Health Indicators Database, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Part D Opioid Prescribing Mapping Tool, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality resource on opioids, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on overdose surveillance and opioid laws. OESRD would expand on these efforts in two important ways. First, it would provide substantially expanded data on determinants of, indicators of, and approaches to combatting the opioid epidemic. This would include: (1) information on the full range of state laws that affect opioid prescribing and access to opioid use disorder services and medications; (2) confidential microdata on local access to the supply of medication-assisted treatment and naloxone and to services to treat opioid use disorders and reduce associated harms; (3) confidential microdata on the legal and illegal opioid supply; (4) confidential microdata on the distribution of overdoses across and within states by type of drug, including types of opioids and other drugs associated with opioid overdose (i.e., cocaine, stimulants, benzodiazepines); and (5) available evidence on the effectiveness of current prevention and treatment approaches to address the opioid epidemic. In addition, OESRD could be linked with the City Health Dashboard and County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, so that OESRD could also integrate extensive data on social and economic factors, the physical environment, and health indicators within and across states. This type of secure data linkage is critical if we are to identify the potential drivers of the opioid epidemic, and how it may be influenced by other determinants of population health. Second, it would offer tools and resources so that potential end-users, including public health officials, policymakers, community members and researchers, could interpret the data. This would include, for example: (1) downloadable datasets of public access versions of the data; (2) downloadable infographics; (3) maps showing the distribution of the prevalence and incidence of overdose rates across cities, counties, and states, by age, sex, race/ethnicity, local features of the social, physical and economic environment, and type of drug; and (4) state and local profiles with local overdose statistics, downloadable charts and local prevention and treatment resources available to address the epidemic in a specified geographic area. DesignThis project is founded on the premise that to track the opioid epidemic, identify future hotspots of opioid-related harm before they occur, and identify effective state and local responses, it is critical to develop a comprehensive resource of securely linked datasets on the determinants of opioid overdose risk, indicators of opioid-related harm, and prevention, treatment and policy approaches. We propose a systematic approach to identify, compile, and link confidential microdata sources to create the first comprehensive national database on the predictors and outcomes associated with the opioid epidemic. The dashboard would coordinate efforts with existing national sources of confidential microdata on opioid use and overdose, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opioid overdose surveillance efforts, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project hospitalization and emergency department data, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, DEA drug seizure data, and IMS Quintiles, among others. The dashboard would harmonize data available from multiple sources, in order to provide a comprehensive, granular, and timely assessment of the profile of the opioid epidemic. Data sourcesDrug laws and policies. The OESRD would draw data from a variety of existing central sources (examples of a more extensive set of laws and policies are listed in Table 1) to create a repository of laws and policies likely to affect opioid prescribing and mitigate opioid-related harm. These data would be updated on annual basis.  Table 1. Examples of law and policy measures proposed for the dashboardConstruct Measure Years Data sourcePrescription drug monitoring programs  PDMP enactment date; PDMP features including whether registration and access are mandatory, number of drug schedules reported, frequency of required data updates, proactive provision of unsolicited reports on outlying patterns of prescribing and dispensing to users; PDMP latent classes12001-on PDAPS, NAMSDL, contacts with state PDMPsPain clinic regulations  State requirements to register with the state/obtain a license/certificate from the state; state clinic inspection authority; requirements regarding ownership and operation of clinic 2006-on PDAPSPrescription limits  Limits on duration of opioid prescription supply for acute pain; limits on long-term opioid prescribing to <90 MED/d;  2001-on Law review2,3Naloxone access laws Prescribers immune from civil/criminal liability, removes criminal liability for possession of naloxone. 2001-on PDAPSOverdose Good Samaritan laws Protection from controlled substance protection laws; drug paraphernalia laws, probation/ parole violations 2007-on PDAPSMAT with methadone laws State restrictions on opioid treatment programs 2006-on PDAPSMedicaid eligibility Medicaid eligibility categories by year, and expansions following the Affordable Care Act ; Medicaid coverage of methadone 2001-on Kaiser report; 4Opioid use disorder services and medications. Using a variety of central data sources, the dashboard would provide access to data on the capacity of health services available to reduce opioid-related harms (i.e., overdose education and naloxone dispensation programs), and to provide opioid disorder treatment (i.e., clinicians with waivers to prescribe buprenorphine, opioid treatment services), as well as on the local naloxone and medication assisted treatment supply. Table 2 lists some examples of the type of information the dashboard could provide on local access to opioid use disorder services and medications. Table 2. Opioid use disorder service and medication access measures proposed for the repositoryConstruct Measure Years Data SourceBuprenorphine treatment capacity Number of physicians at substance abuse treatment facilities and DATA-certified physicians 2018-on SAMHSA Substance abuse treatment/MAT capacity Number of substance abuse treatment facilities that provide MAT services (some, two, all) 2005-2011; 2018-on SAMHSAMAT dispensed supply Monthly number of prescriptions dispensed for buprenorphine and naltrexone by formulation; monthly number of patients receiving a prescription for buprenorphine or naltrexone 2006-on IMS Health and QuintilesNaloxone dispensed supply Monthly number of prescriptions for naloxone; monthly number of patients receiving a prescription for naloxone 2006-on IMS Health and QuintilesEmergency Medical Services  Administration of naloxone; complaints associated with administration of naloxone, with demographics 2014-on Request to states for NEMSIS dataThe opioid supply. The dashboard would provide access to data on trends in the legal and illegal drug supply across the United States, and track shifts in drug markets in so far as they may affect opioid overdose risk. This includes DEA drug seizure data, as well as provider- and patient-level data on retail sales of opioids and associated controlled substances, such as benzodiazepines. Table 3. The drug supplyHeroin price and purity Price and purity estimates, from DEA samples and purchases, and corrected for selection bias 2001-on DEA System to Retrieve Information for Drug EvidenceFentanyl law enforcement seizures Number of illicit drug seizures tested and confirmed to be fentanyl to DEA  2015-on DEA Reports 5Opioid prescriptions Rate of opioid prescriptions per 1000 residents; mean opioid dose (MME) per patient; % of patients getting >90MME; opioid-benzodiazepine overlap; multiple provider episode rates by quarter and year; mean number of opioid prescriptions written per day per prescriber percentile rank;  2007-on IMS QuintilesOpioid use, overdose, and related outcomes. A critical component of the OESRD would be indicators of opioid-related harm. These would include data on fatal overdoses and hospitalizations and emergency department visits associated with overdoses, as well as survey data on the precursors to overdose, namely medical and non-medical use of prescription opioids, misuse of prescription opioids, heroin use, and opioid use disorder. This data would be provided as overall rates, but also broken down by demographic subgroups (sex, race/ethnicity, age), and presented at the finest level of geography available, so OESRD users can track the progression of the opioid overdose epidemic across time, space, and subgroups. Table 4. Indicators of opioid-related harmOverdose deaths Monthly number of deaths from all drugs; from natural/semi-synthetic opioids; methadone; synthetics other than methadone; other drugs 2001-on CDC WonderInpatient hospital stays for overdoses Monthly number of hospital discharges associated with overdose by type of drug 2001-on Statewide Inpatient Sample; individual requests to statesEmergency department admissions for overdose Monthly number of ED admissions associated with overdose by type of drug 2001-on State Emergency Department Databases Opioid use, misuse, and disorders Nonmedical and medical prescription opioid use, heroin use, benzodiazepine use, opioid use disorder 2004-0n National Survey on Drug Use and HealthSocial, economic, and physical environment factors associated with opioid overdose risk. The OESRD could be linked with the City Health Dashboard and County Health Rankings and Roadmaps to access relevant local data on social and economic factors (e.g., education, poverty, housing costs, unemployment, residential segregation, violent crime), the physical environment (e.g., housing conditions, access to parks), health conditions (e.g., mental distress, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, premature deaths), and clinical services (e.g., insurance, primary care access, preventive care services access). OESRD users can apply this data to examine potential drivers of the opioid epidemic. What works in prevention and treatment.  A central question of policymakers, public health officials and community leaders is what action to take to most effectively to combat the opioid epidemic. OESRD can provide key actors with the state-of-the-art information on the types of prevention and treatment approaches and the strength of the evidence underlying each.  This section would also provide case examples where such approaches were implemented, possibly including contact information for practitioners involved in implementing such approaches across states. An example of this type of information is available here.Data linkage and analysisOESRD would provide an integrated data infrastructure to compile and harmonize data across a wide variety of already centralized sources of confidential microdata, including many enumerated above. However, for certain measures, data would need to be extracted from individual states (e.g., prescription opioid and Medicaid laws; EMS data on naloxone administration) or from reports/online queries (e.g., buprenorphine treatment capacity, substance abuse treatment capacity, drug seizure data, National Survey on Drug Use and Health), or purchased (IMS Quintiles data on retail sales of naloxone, MAT, and prescription opioids).  OESRD would provide a secure environment within which government agencies providing data could place and share their data. A module system would control who had access to which data, and how the different data sources were connected through a secure platform. Sparse data would be suppressed to ensure confidentiality and stability of the data. Mapped state and local data would be compiled in a project geographic information system (GIS) that supports all reporting and statistical analysis activities.  GIS compilation enables mapping of all data elements, characterization of spatial topologies for statistical analysis, and support for the assessment of unit misalignments that affect analyses of county level data.  Data would be linked by available identifiers – with the level of resolution varying by data source - and the database would be flexible enough to accommodate multiple linkage options, including state, county, city, year, quarter, and month. Data would be stored and accessed with a secure database management system: once entered, it would be stored in tables. The OESRD would allow users to calculate and map, among others, annual rates of opioid overdose-related deaths and hospitalizations, overall and by age, sex, race/ethnic and type of opioid (i.e., natural/semi-synthetic, non-methadone synthetic, methadone, and heroin). Users could create maps of, among others, the geographic distribution of MAT treatment capacity, MAT dispensed supply, and naloxone dispensed supply across local areas and states over the study period. Data could be downloaded, used to conduct comparisons across geographic or demographic units, or to prepare site-specific in-depth profiles of the opioid overdose problem in specific areas (i.e., states, counties, cities). Project teamTo develop a comprehensive tool that responds to the data and policy needs of a wide range of audiences, it is important to involve a team that has substantive expertise in the opioid epidemic, including policy experts, epidemiologists, and physicians, as well as expertise in using big data to build usable, secure, web-based, granular dashboards. Such a team, including national experts on substance use epidemiology, treatment and policy, and with experience in successfully launching national data dashboards, exists at New York University. The team recently launched a City Health Dashboard, capturing diverse measures of health, health behaviors, social and economic and environmental determinants of health, and equity, for the largest 500 US cities (population 66,000 and above).  These data, presented at the city and census tract level, are now freely and easily accessible to city and community leaders, national officials, researchers, business leaders, and other stakeholders.  A similar paradigm, with different, significantly enhanced and opioid-focused inputs and the ability to aggregate data by diverse geographies and attributes, could provide the backbone functionality for the OESRD.    NYU’s Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF) could be a key incubator for this project, given their extensive experience building systems to compile, store, and use confidential microdata. ADRF could act as the incubator under the leadership of the NYU Center on Opioid Epidemiology and Policy.Key stakeholder entities would include: federal agencies, such as CDC, SAMHSA, NIDA, and CMS, as well as foundations, such as Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies and Gates Foundation. ""LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Estimates empower local economic development initiatives to develop policies and effectiveness metrics.

Submitted by: GSA.","In the use cases described below with CMS on Blue Button 2.0 and with SSA for verification of consumer information with a financial institution, it's not a matter of data sharing between agencies, but brokering data sharing between the user and a third party in the private sector. I can try to share this better through the official process for the Data Strategy, but this got me thinking it'd be good to identify some common patterns for data sharing and exchange and then work to develop and highlight the best practices and standards both from different perspectives including: legal/administrative/agreements, privacy/security, data interoperability, etc. A few of the key data flow patterns I'm thinking of are:- aggregation - typically a hierarchical aggregation flow, such as from local->state->federal often with many statistical agencies or for reporting on the use of federal funds, or from federal agencies to OMB including things like POD metadata or the Data Act. These are the main flows we're starting with on the Data Federation project- agency to agency exchange - this is where agencies are creating agreements to share data directly with one another, benefits eligibility is a common scenario where this plays out. - user consent based data exchange - this is where the user actually provides consent explicitly for data exchange by granting one agency/entity access to their data from another agency/entity as with the examples below. I'm just spitballing here, but I've been starting to coalesce my thinking around these types of common patterns more and more and I feel like they're likely to have common legal and technical solutions when viewed that way. ""If the government developed a common design language for data visualization, it could enhance government data products and services at scale. Submitted by: U.S. Department of Education.","• Establish a design language for data visualization, U.S. Web Design Standards-style. In the same way that the U.S. Web Design Standards empowers teams across the federal government to “build fast, accessible, and mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research,” a well-resourced data visualization language could bootstrap and en-hance government data products and services at scale.o Leading private-sector companies have invested in design systems to drive data innovation, including IBM, which partnered with a renowned information design consultancy to “create a new set of guidelines to help IBMers from all over the world design innovative and effective data-driven products . . . The guidelines in-clude directions, original designs, animation samples, and interactive examples.”o The federal government could conduct a similar exercise, tapping internal and external expertise to develop lower- and higher-order guidance on chart models, data storytelling, and interface design for data-driven products and services. Guiding principles could be translated into repurposable components, from the simple (e.g., Excel chart templates) to the relatively complex (e.g., code snippets for building interactive dashboards), and organized in a common repository as a universal resource.""If the government deployed text categorization, it could report representative results to the public without violating sensitivities or overloading the public with too much granular data. Submitted by: High Point LLC.","LEVERAGING DATA AS A STRATEGIC ASSETAutomated text categorization is a powerful tool that allows agencies to efficiently summarize useful information buried in mountains of text. Wherever comments are recorded (public or internal), text categorization methods can be used to better understand what people are saying, and to identify trends, providing opportunities for a more focused response. READING PUBLIC OPINIONText categorization, specifically sentiment tagging, can improve agency awareness of public concerns. For example, sentiment tagging feedback from the public could quickly identify comments for & against an initiative by locating very positive and negative sentiment. With similar comments automatically grouped together, identifying common patterns would become a much simpler task for administrators.Sentiment analysis also readily forms a framework for assessing changes in public opinion – with sentiment measures in place, an alert system for sudden swings in comment sentiment would become trivial to implement. Contrast this with manual comment audits (which are labor-intensive and would not cover all comments), and the value of an automated approach quickly becomes clear: effectiveness of current programs/solutions can now be measured using feedback directly from the public.COMMUNICATING WITH THE PUBLICCategorized text allow agencies to report representative results to the public without releasing an entire free-text dataset. In the right situation, summarization (1) protects sensitive data from comments while simultaneously (2) organizing findings into a simple, reader-friendly overview for the public, which (3) prevents “information overload” and public confusion.Pairing text summarization with a limited set of real examples makes policing sensitive data exposure much less onerous while also providing public transparency into the data being considered. Providing easy-to-understand, relevant information provides the public a “big picture” view of the current discussions and the steps being taken in response. As an agency, this openness reinforces the message, “We hear you.”""When data from multiple sources is combined and monitored, more timely and cohesive reactions can be triggered. Submitted by: Qlik.","Public HealthAgencies can gain better insight into existing and emerging public health crises with the right data. Take the opioid crisis, for example. Imagine if federal, state and local agencies had a mechanism for easily sharing and analyzing their combined data. The collective data would yield huge insights the could provide local first responders with the ability to save more lives.The City of Surry, in British Columbia, is using data to identify and respond to Opioid outbreaks. When a series of events occurs indicating an outbreak (more than 4 emergency calls for heart failure within a 1 hour time period within a half-mile radius), an alert goes out to the chiefs of police, fire, ambulance and social workers. All four organizations then team up to respond to the crisis:https://blog.qlik.com/city-of-surrey-addresses-opioid-crisis-with-help-of-qlik.Here’s another example leveraging Centers for Disease Control & Prevention data, highlighting how data can inform where the problems are most pervasive: https://demos.qlik.com/qliksense/OpioidCrisisAnalysis.""If the Federal Procurement Data System is modernized, citizens, industry, and agencies will derive more valuable insights from it.

We believe the federal data strategy shouldhave a strong focus on addressing critical problems faced by the federal government, using data.To address these problems, we want to stress the importance of cross-agency policies and data sharing within the federal government as well as the need to share data across governmental bodies, i.e. feds sharing with states and local governments.Despite the legal impediments to sharing certain data, the goal should be open access by default, with plans to address the protection of confidential and personally identifiable information, while encouraging an analytics mindset. We encourage identification of issues/problems which the government aims to solve, a review of the data available associated with those problems, and the development of plans to use data to better understand and address – in that order. Too often we look first at what data is available and then try to identify what problems can be addressed. This approach leaves a lot on the table as far as how data can help agencies solve problems.""If a office for data management were created, it could serve as a single front door for federal data and improve data access for all. Submitted by: Third Sector Capital Partners, Inc.","Availability and usefulnessWe have found that there are inconsistent guidelines for privacy protecting data aggregation. When we report aggregate or summary statistics it is helpful if there is a common standard for when aggregate data is no longer considered private. There is no general community consensus and no consistent federal guidelines on privacy protecting data aggregation. This lack of guidance creates reticence in otherwise eager local and state privacy, risk, contracts, and general counsel offices. Partners in local- and state-level data projects (like academic institutions, advisory firms, and external experts) often hold the liability for accidental exposure and are risk intolerant. Akin to how Treasury provides capital retention requirements that allow the banking system to understand what level of risk is generally acceptable, guidelines for privacy management would spur innovation. Another barrier to using data is the variation in format of data use agreements, even between different federal agencies. The differences in requirements and processes between agencies inhibits replicating successes made with one agency. Even when the requirements are substantially the same, agency-specific process and forms force users to start near the bottom of the learning curve each time they would like to access a new data set. This presents an unnecessary barrier to data access. Even a single standard request approach with agency-specific appendices would make it much easier to navigate from the outside. Given the above constraints, availability is primarily dependent on knowing who to contact within the agency, the relationship with that person, and their available time to guide you through the process. Making the front door more accessible is an important starting point in unlocking the potential for federal data to improve government performance and life outcomes for constituents. As it stands today, each agency (and sometimes each dataset) has its own front door, making it difficult for new entrants to know who to talk to, how to find out about access procedures, and where to get additional information about the data. Much like the Office of Personnel Management professionalized and standardized civil service, a similar office for data management could make federal data a national strategic asset as opposed to an asset available only to those who have existing relationships and agreements with the sponsoring agencies.""When the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and partners launched a Pay for Success initiative, data helped agencies create more sustained change in the lives of those they serve.

Over seven years, about 1000 young men in the probation or parole system, exiting the juvenile justice system, or leaving custody of the House of Correction will receive targeted life skills, education, and employment programming. The U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) awarded the first-of-its-kind PFS grant of $11.7 million for the Commonwealth to extend the project, should it prove successful, to an additional 391 young men, thereby serving over 1,300 young men over nine years. DoL uses the state’s Unemployment Insurance (UI) database to validate the number of quarters of employment rather than using the IRS data (https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-tax-statistics). The recidivism metric is based on Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS) Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) data.

Our analysis partner, American Institutes for Research (AIR), examined several data sources to determine whether the datasets are representative of the target population of veterans who are eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation & Education program (VR&E) funded training, including the American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 (https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm), and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html). Because the Veteran Affairs (VA) data was not directly available, we created a synthetic comparison pool of individuals by mimicking the VA’s VR&E eligibility criteria for veterans with SCDs across these databases. We looked at potential outcomes from these data sources that covered employment and earning, poverty status, highest level of education, frequency of poor mental/physical health days, and frequency of alcohol/marijuana consumption. While this project didn’t move forward, the public data was able to fill the gap created by not having access to the primary VA data. Ultimately, the operational coordination issues stopped the project at the feasibility stage, it was a great use case on how public, non-sensitive data can still inform better decision-making.""When Veritas helped organizations implement data governance, they realized many positive outcomes, such as better understanding of data risk and value. Submitted by: Veritas.","Use Case 2: In healthcare, a data governance strategy is absolutely critical and must extend beyond the data contained in an electronic medical record (EMR), as over 80% of the world’s healthcare data is unstructured. This includes all electronic communication and all of the organization’s files, whether they are stored on premise or in the cloud. Veritas’ Integrated Classification Engine supports numerous public sector and private sector healthcare organizations by scanning and tagging this data to provide the visibility, security, and protection of both structured and unstructured patient data, giving clinicians a better view of a patient’s health over time.In addition to protecting health information and ensuring availability, providers must know what information they have and how to use that data effectively and securely. Veritas’ approach to data governance in these organizations has led to many positive outcomes, including:- A complete understanding of data risks, assets, and vulnerabilities;- Compliance with HIPAA and other relevant regulations; - Enhanced value of content to ease end-user access, discovery, search, and supervision; and - New sources of business intelligence and analytics insights.The visibility and control of data are prerequisites for healthcare organizations to comply with HIPAA.Establishing a repeatable HIPAA compliance framework improves patient outcomes while increasing reimbursement for these institutions. Veritas helps reduce costs by offering valuable metadata that enables these organization to take appropriate action on how best to store and recover patient data.Information Map gives backup and storage administrators visibility into what they are actually backing up. This helps identify all of the health information that needs to be protected, as well as data that should not be protected on the organization’s infrastructure. Data Insight is used to provide intelligence about all of the unstructured data within a healthcare organization, helping identify information in unsecure locations, such as user workstations or shares, and ensuring data is always protected.The ultimate goal for a healthcare provider is to reach a steady state where content is efficiently stored for as long as it is needed, classified and categorized in near real-time, and ultimately disposed of when possible to reduce risk and storage costs. While data governance is required to meet healthcare regulations and to ensure litigation readiness, proper governance also leads to cost savings, a more effective workforce, and greater efficiencies throughout these organization.""When PCORnet pooled electronic health records, it enabled clinical data research and aided in development of a common data model for integrating records.

Submitted by: SAS Institute Inc..","One example of commercialization comes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA is in a unique position to be an industry market maker, given the abundance of data it currently collects, as well as new technology that allows for the rapid generation and processing of data into useful information. Advancements in predictive analytics, for example, are allowing cities and local governments to create personalized or micro-weather forecasts to better predict weather-related business impacts. These approaches combine data from a variety of sources, including the Census, to simulate or model the impact of weather on a variety of different economic entities (e.g., air travel, tourism, public transportation). Such knowledge is being used by city planners to create better budgets, anticipate resource needs, and react to emergencies more efficiently. One can envision future use of such data in many other sectors. Consider medicine: NOAA data may one day be used to anticipate outbreaks of asthma and other respiratory disorders, including the flu, and better plan for them (e.g., alert local pharmacies and health care clinics, redirect pharmaceutical shipments). The applications are vast and growing as the types of available data continue to grow and access to those data improves.

Having standardized data elements that can populate/import the common data elements will streamline the procurement process for federal agencies, make it easier for companies to do business with the federal agency, and make it easier for the financial markets to provide products and services.The complete XBRL US GAAP taxonomy contains all the data fields for public companies to report their financial statement to the SEC, but that volume of data elements is too much for most common entities, and subset of data elements defined as a Basic Financial Statement can contain enough data fields to be comprehensive enough for most purposes.Having a Basic Financial Statement with a condensed list of data elements would enable a wide range of software systems to incorporate the import/export functionality and contribute to a streamlined procurement process for federal agencies that require financial statements for private entities, make it easier for entities to so business with the federal agency and improve access to surety and bank credit.""When DOT implemented data driven funding decisions, including performance management, it enabled regular monitoring and allowed DOT to demonstrate performance against their stated objectives. Submitted by: Bureau of the Census (USBC) .","Case Study #4 – Transportation: Utah DOT ties State Funding Directly to OutcomesThe Utah Department of Transportation Highways Division (UDOT) was looking for a way to enable data driven funding decisions and allow for the measurement of the outcomes of those decisions.Starting with their Strategic Direction, UDOT uses the Socrata platform to transform static PDF files into an interactive site that demonstrates performance against stated objectives. Additionally, UDOT uses the Socrata platform to identify and standardize datasets from around UDOT. This allowed all the data, regardless of source, to be accessed via the Socrata platform's API interfaces. All of this is done in a secure FedRamp Moderate environment.Now, the department can regularly and automatically update, track, and communicate their performance.Please see Attachment6_ Utah DOT for additional detail on this Case Study."If the government centralizes grants management data it will enable data analysis. Submitted by: Bureau of the Census (USBC) .,"Case Study #5 – Grants ManagementToday, grants management data is highly decentralized. It can take weeks and months to accumulate data from all the necessary departments. The process is manual, labor intensive, relies on emails and spreadsheets, and often resides with a single clerk tasked with gathering the information.What is needed is a single, central repository for the data that can be used by many.Data Visualization: Data needs to be presented in a structured way, making it easier to interpret, analyze, extrapolate, and report out. Real-time views of financial and non-financial information should be accessible through an easy-to-use dashboard.Process Reminders and Standards: Automated timeline reminders and reporting requirement workflows could provide compliance check-ins across the grant lifecycle. With standardized data processes, everyone from program managers to financial professionals can trust that a system is in place to make sure reporting is complete and on-time.Socrata's platform allows all levels of government to access and use data throughout the life cycle of a federal grant.The Socrata platform allows all levels of government to standardize reporting data, evaluate it, track progress and report outcomes. In addition, the Socrata platform's API's allow internal and external sharing of the data.See a detailed description of his case study in Attachement7_Grants Management.""If state and local credential programs adopt data standards for program, credential, and competency information it will enable the identification of investments in education,  reduce costs to the federal agencies, and further enable the labor market to meet industry demands.  Submitted by: T3 Innovation Network .","Increasing the Availability of Consumer Information on Return on Investment for Programs and Credentials. Building on inter-agency efforts like the College Scorecard, as well as public-private collaborations like LEHD's partnership with the University of Texas system, there is a significant opportunity to scale up the voluntary provision of programmatic and credential information from states and individual education and training providers to connect individual participant records with long-term labor market outcomes and make metrics around return on investment in education more broadly available. Several foundations and funders are actively working in creating data standards for program, credential, and competency information and make it easier for education and training institutions to be able to share this data as part of data collaboratives and those efforts could dramatically reduce the costs to federal agencies for receiving and connecting individual and programmatic data, while broadening the set of programs and providers connecting their data. Stakeholders could include NASWA, IMS Global, AACRAO, Dxterra, the Lumina Foundation, Gates Foundation, and others.B1""When the Brazilian government partnered with the private sector and labor/trade unions, and produced statistics on a five-year rolling basis on the skill and labor needs by geographic areas, it enabled the Brazilian government to meet emerging labor needs.
